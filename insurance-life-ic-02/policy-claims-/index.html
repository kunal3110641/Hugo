<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter explains the different aspects of policy claims. After
going through the chapter, you will get a clear picture of various kinds
of policy claims and insurance riders etc.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>

<h2 id="1-explain-policy-claims-and-their-different-types-learning-outcome-a">1. Explain policy claims and their different types. [Learning Outcome a]</h2>
<h2 id="11-policy-claims">1.1 Policy Claims</h2>
<p>In simple words, claim means to demand something
for which one has a right.</p>
<p>Arun deposits Rs. 4,000 every month with his friend, Hari, on the
agreement that Hari will pay him back a lump sum of Rs. 50,000 at the
end of 12 months. He keeps depositing money for 12 months so that he can
have a lump sum of Rs. 50,000 at the end of the year, to buy a scooter.
In this case, Arun can demand Rs. 50,000 after 12 months from Hari as he
has the right to claim it. Another example of simple claim is as
follows:</p>
<p>Anand buys a life insurance policy of Rs 50 lakhs to protect his family
in case of his unfortunate death. He dies due to a serious scooter
accident leaving the family behind. His wife, who is the nominee under
the policy, can claim the insurance amount from the insurance company.
In insurance parlance, policy claim means asking for policy money under
the terms of an insurance policy.</p>
<p>A demand on the insurer to fulfil its promise, as per the terms and
conditions of the policy, is called a &lsquo;policy claim&rsquo; An insurance claim
is: a formal request to an insurance company; asking for a payment;
based on the terms of the insurance policy Insurance claims are reviewed
by the company for their validity and then once approved, are paid out
to the insured (in case of survival or maturity claims) or requesting
party (nominee / beneficiary on behalf of the insured).</p>
<p>An insurer is the company selling the insurance policy. An insured is a
person or a company purchasing the insurance policy. The fee paid by the
insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called premium.</p>
<p>If a man toils hard in his youth, earns a lot of money, enjoys a
prosperous life and dies after 70 years of age then his dependents may
not suffer a great financial loss; other than an emotional loss.
However, in case he dies in his youth, his family will be in a terrible
state, both financially and emotionally. It is here that insurance cover
can help the family financially. So, if the person was insured, the
family could make a claim with the insurance company as per the terms of
the insurance contract and use the policy claim money to handle
immediate expenses. The operative clause of a life insurance policy
states that the insurer will pay to the policyholder or nominee or
beneficiary or any other person who may have a right to receive it,
certain sums of money on the happening of specified events. When such
events happen, the insurer has to fulfil the promise of making the
payments. When a claim is being settled, the insurer is fulfilling the
promise made in the policy. th</p>
<p>Mr. Tom worked on the 104 floor of the World Trade Center (WTC) and was
in a elevator when the first place struck the tower during the terror
attach. Harry died on the spot. His family was protected from financial
distress when the insurance company paid out his large insurance claim
from the insurance policy that he was covered under.</p>
<h2 id="12-types-of-policy-claims">1.2 Types of policy claims</h2>
<p>In a contract of life insurance, there are
three common types of claims: Claim by maturity: claims may arise
because of survival of the insured up to the end of the policy term,
which is the date of maturity. This is normally paid in endowment
assurance policies when the policy matures. Pure term plans do not have
a maturity claim pay-out .Such policies are eligible for payment only as
death claims, when the life-assured dies during the policy term. Claim
at periodic intervals-- survival benefits: claims may arise because of
survival of the insured up to a specified period during the term. Such
regular periodic payments are often made in money-back policies.</p>
<p>Claim by death: claim may arise due to the death of the life assured
during the term of the policy.</p>
<h2 id="maturity-claims">Maturity claims</h2>
<p>A maturity claim is
payable as per the terms of the contract at the end of the term of the
policy, if the life assured lives up to that date.</p>
<p>Naresh has taken an Endowment insurance policy of Rs. 500,000 for 10
years for a premium of Rs. 7,333. If he lives up to the end of the term
of the policy, i.e. 10 years, he can demand maturity claim as per the
terms of the policy.</p>
<p>Maturity claim requires the following documents for settling the claims:
original insurance policy document discharge form, duly stamped, signed
and witnessed proof of age in case the policy was issued without the age
proof where age was not admitted at the time of policy inception
document of assignment, in case of any assignment The maturity claim is
equal to the sum assured plus bonus and other guaranteed addition (if
any). Any debt or charge under the policy, such as loan, loan interest,
outstanding premium (due but not paid), etc. will be deducted. The
discharge voucher will show the gross amount of claim, the deductions,
if any, and the net amount payable. The gross amount normally consists
of the basic sum assured or the paid up value, the bonus payable, any
excess deposit lying in the said policy account and return of excess
premiums collected, if any. For example, extra premium for double
accident benefit was lowered by the LIC a few years back, but it was
decided to refund the excess premium at the time of settlement of claim.
This was to be added to the basic sum assured. The deductions (monthly
in respect of salary savings scheme policies) from the gross amounts
normally consist of loan amount, outstanding interest on the loan,
unpaid premium, if any, and any other charges.</p>
<p>If there is a loan subsisting, the policy document would already be with
the insurer, as the policy has to be assigned in favour of the insurer
before getting the loan. Settlement of maturity claims is usually free
from complications relating to title, as policy moneys are generally
paid only to the policyholder. The nominee is irrelevant in the case of
maturity claim. In case the policy is absolutely assigned, then the
settlement is made in favour of the absolute assignee. Insurers
generally initiate action on their own, well in advance from the
maturity date so that the policyholder receives the claim cheque on the
date of maturity. When maturity claim is paid, the insurance contract is
revoked and then there is no insurance cover with the policyholder.
There is another alternative for payment of maturity claims which is
known as settlement option. Under the settlement option the policyholder
can choose to receive the claim amount in instalments spread over a
specified period as per mutual agreement with the insurer. If at the
time of claim the original policy document is not found, insurers may be
willing to settle the maturity claim on the basis of an indemnity bond
unless the circumstances warrant more caution.</p>
<h2 id="13-periodic-survival-benefits">1.3 Periodic survival benefits</h2>
<p>The Money Back plans promise payment of
part of the SA (sum assured) at specific intervals, during the term of
the policy. The surviving policyholder is paid on a specified
pre-determined periods a percentage of the sum assured as periodic
survival benefit. As in the case of maturity claims, the specified
amounts are paid on the due dates, after deduction of the outstanding
loan interest, outstanding premium, X charge etc. Survival benefit
claims require the following documents: discharge form duly stamped,
signed and witnessed original policy document If the policyholder dies
after the due date, but before settlement of claim, the rights for that
survival benefit vest in the estate of the deceased policyholder. The
claim amount is then payable to the legal heirs of the policyholder. The
insurer may settle the claim on the basis of an indemnity bond or ask
for a declaration of title from appropriate judicial authorities. Will
(if any) has to be probated.</p>
<h2 id="14-death-claims">1.4 Death claims</h2>
<h2 id="procedure-to-be-followed-in-case-of-death-claim">The payment of the sum assured amount in case the
insured person dies, is called death claim. It is necessary to
scrutinize all documents submitted by the heirs of the deceased person.
An insurance contract comes to an end after paying the insurance claim.
Insurance agents should help the heirs of the deceased person to receive
the insurance claim by submitting proper documents in time.
Procedure to be followed in case of death claim</h2>
<p>The following is the procedure to be
followed for receiving death claims: (i) Intimation of death The first
step is to send an &lsquo;intimation of death&rsquo; to the branch office of the
insurance company from where the policy was issued. The intimation
should be sent in writing by any of the below mentioned persons: the
nminee the assignee of the policy the relative of the deceased
policyholder the employer an agent or the Development Officer The letter
of intimation of death should contain the following information: name of
the life assured a statement that the life assured is dead the date of
the death the cause of death the place of death the relationship of the
claimant with the assured the policy number Certificate of death issued
by the Municipal authorities/ Public record office that maintains these
records (mandated by certain insurers at the point of claim intimation
,itself) As soon as the branch office receives the intimation of death
and is satisfied about the genuineness of the intimation, it verifies
the status of the policy and sends the necessary claim forms along with
instructions regarding the procedure to be followed and requirements to
be fulfilled by the claimant.</p>
<h2 id="ii-submission-of-proof-of-death">(ii) Submission of proof of death</h2>
<p>The proof of death is a certificate
issued by the Municipal Death Registry or by a Public Record Office
which maintains the records of births and deaths in the locality. Other
statements or certificates are also required to be given in the
prescribed claim form, such as: a statement by the doctor who last
treated the deceased a certificate by the hospital where the
policyholder died a certificate from the employer where the policyholder
last worked a certificate of cremation or burial (this is generally
called in &ldquo;early claim&rdquo; cases)</p>
<h2 id="iii-submission-of-age-proof">(iii) Submission of age proof</h2>
<p>The claimant should submit an age proof
of the policyholder in case it was not submitted earlier. The following
documents are generally accepted as valid age proof: Birth certificate
School certificate Certificate relating to baptism ceremony among
Christians Passport (which is within the validity period)</p>
<h2 id="iv-proof-of-title-of-the-claimant">(iv) Proof of title of the claimant</h2>
<p>If the policy has been assigned in a valid manner
or the nomination is subsisting at the time of death, no proof of title
is needed. In case there is no valid nomination or assignment, the
claimant will have to produce satisfactory evidence of title to the
estate of the deceased, from a competent judicial authority. The
authority may be the Administrator General or a court, and should grant:
a succession certificate; or letters of administration; or letters of
probate; or a registered will A Succession Certificate is issued by a
competent court on the question of right to the property of the
deceased. The Succession Certificate is issued on application and should
specifically provide for disbursement of policy monies. If, however, the
deceased has left a will, a probate (process of validation of will) of
the will is required along with the copy of the will.</p>
<h2 id="v-payment-of-the-policy">(v) Payment of the policy</h2>
<p>When all the formalities are completed, the
insurance company issues a discharge form for completion which is to be
signed by the person entitled to receive policy money. Such person can
be: the nominee, if nomination was made under the policy the assignee,
if the policy was assigned the legal representative or successor
According to the IRDA regulations, a life insurer has to process the
death claim without delay. The insurance company sends the cheque for
the amount due to the person entitled to receive it, within 30 days from
the date all formalities were completed (for non-early claims ,as early
claims would need to be investigated by the insurers before they pay out
the claim)</p>

<h2 id="learning-outcome-b">Discuss the types of death claims: early claims and non-early claims.
[Learning Outcome b]</h2>
<p>Death claims are classified into two categories:
early claims and non early claims</p>
<h2 id="21-early-claims">2.1 Early claims</h2>
<p>Claims arising within two years of the date of
commencement or revival are termed as &rsquo;early death claims&rsquo;. They are
also referred to as &lsquo;premature death claims&rsquo;. th</p>
<p>st</p>
<p>Jatin had taken life insurance on 30 November 2004. He died of sickness
on 31 th March 2006. If Jatin&rsquo;s heirs lodged a death claim with the
insurance company on 30 April, 2006, it would be considered an &rsquo;early
claim&rsquo;, as the claim had arisen within two years of the date of
commencement of the insurance policy.</p>
<h2 id="documents-required-in-case-of-early-claims">Documents required in case of early claims</h2>
<p>In case death occurs in less
than two years from the date of commencement of policy, the following
documents are required: Policy document Discharge voucher Assignment
deed, if any Age proof document (if age is not admitted) Proof of title
of claimant Statement by the doctor who last treated the deceased
Statement by the hospital where the policyholder died Statement from the
employer about the leave, if any, taken by the life assured on grounds
of sickness Certificate of cremation or burial</p>
<p>Early claims are to be dealt with cautiously. It is assumed that a
person, who is accepted as good for life insurance, is not likely to die
within two years. Therefore, when an early claim occurs, there is a need
to make sure that there was no attempt to defraud the insurance company.
Enquiries are made to confirm that no information was suppressed. This
is done both to ensure the genuineness of the claim and safeguard the
interests of the community of policyholders. The decision to admit the
claim is taken on the basis of information gathered during enquiries and
the evidence collected. The insurer can deny liability under an early
claim on the ground that material information had been suppressed at the
time of proposal. A misrepresentation is adequate to repudiate
liability, in case of early claims. However, insurers usually do not
repudiate the contract only on grounds of misrepresentation unless there
is evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>In India, Section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938 states that two years
from the date of policy, the insurance company cannot question the
contract unless certain conditions are fulfilled. The Supreme Court of
India, in the case of Mithoulal Nayak vs Life Insurance Corporation of
India (LIc), summarised the three conditions: The information in doubt
must be material. The suppression must be fraudulently made by the
policyholder. The policyholder must have known at the time of making the
statement that it was false. The onus of proving that these three
conditions are satisfied is on the insurer. Thus, the repudiation of a
death claim is done by insurers only after obtaining evidence in support
of the fact of suppression.</p>
<p>We know that leave taken on medical grounds is material information.
This does not necessarily mean that the claim can be repudiated on this
reason, as he had disclosed it on his proposal form. Before coming to
any conclusion, insurers would try to confirm whether the reason/
illness for which the life-assured had taken leave and which was not
disclosed in proposal form, was material to the terms of acceptance of
the policy. Based on this, the insurance company would take a decision
of admitting or repudiating the claim. This may warrant a claim
investigation.</p>
<h2 id="22-non-early-claims">2.2 Non-early claims</h2>
<p>Claims arising after more than two years of the
date of risk or revival or reinstatement are non-early claims. nd</p>
<p>th</p>
<p>Lalit had taken a life insurance policy on 22 May, 2005 from LIC. He
died on 24 th October 2009. Now, if his heirs had lodged a death claim
with the LIC on 30 December, 2009, it would be considered a &rsquo;non-early
claim&rsquo; as the claim had arisen after two years from the date of
commencement of the insurance policy.</p>
<p>Once the insurer is satisfied about the genuineness of the intimation,
the status of the policy is verified and the documents are called for.
In respect of non-early claims, the normal documents required would be:</p>
<p>Original policy document Discharge voucher duly completed, signed,
stamped and witnessed Deeds of assignment, if any Claimant&rsquo;s statement
giving details of cause of death, nature of illness suffered, treatment,
cremation etc. Age proof document, if not submitted earlier Proof of
title of claimant Original death certificate</p>
<p>Many policyholders perpetrate fraud by cheating or lying on paper
(proposal form) A fraud involves policy owners lying and reporting many
claims on a single injury in health claims. The policy holder does not
declare that he is suffering from a disease. The insurer can repudiate
such claims in the case of any malpractice being proved true.</p>
<h2 id="23-death-due-to-accident-or-unnatural-causes">2.3 Death due to accident or unnatural causes</h2>
<p>If death was due to
accident or unnatural causes, following additional documents would be
required,based on the mode of death (e.g. poisoning, murder, drowning,
vehicular accident etc.): Post-mortem report Police inquest report
Panchanama report Magistrate&rsquo;s report/Coroner&rsquo;s verdict Forensic report
Chemical Analysis report of viscera (organs).The above mentioned
documents would be required in early as well as non-early death claims.</p>
<p>While settling accident benefits under a life insurance policy, the
insurer has every right to ensure that the cause of death is an
accident. The cause that is directly responsible for the death in life
insurance is called Proximate Cause or &lsquo;Causa Proxima&rsquo; and the other
causes are called remote causes. When an insured loss occurs due to more
than one cause, then it needs to be ascertained whether the loss had
arisen directly due to the peril insured upon or due to some other
cause.</p>
<p>Question 2 What type of claims are investigated before a pay out?
Maturity claims Early claims Non early claims Survival Benefit Payment</p>
<h2 id="of-death-learning-outcome-c">Learn about proof of title of claimant, claim concession and presumption
of death. [Learning Outcome c]</h2>
<h2 id="31-proof-of-title-of-claimant">3.1 Proof of title of claimant</h2>
<p>Proof of the title of claimant claiming the policy money is important so that the
benefits are paid to the person legally entitled to receive payment.
Otherwise, the insurer will get involved in disputes between rival
claimants. If the policyholder is alive, the claimant is the
policyholder himself. If there is a death claim, the claimant is the
nominee under Section 39 of the Insurance Act If there is no nomination,
the claimant is the legal heir, who needs to prove their identity
thorugh a succession certificate or a probate of will, if a will exists.
If the policy is assigned, the claimant is the asignee.</p>
<h2 id="32-nomination">3.2 Nomination</h2>
<p>The facility of nomination is provided to ensure easy and fast transfer
of insurance money to the insured person&rsquo;s legal heirs. However, many a
times, it is seen that there are a lot of problems in determining the
succession rights, and legal suits go on for a long time. Nomination is
a good way to solve this problem.</p>
<p>The proposer can nominate somebody in his immediate family to accept all
the insurance benefits after him, at the time of taking an insurance
policy. It is important to note that the nominee is not the owner of the
entire policy amount. He is paid the amount only as a representative of
the legal heirs and it is the nominee&rsquo;s duty to distribute the money
properly among all the legal heirs. The policyholder can also change
nominee/s if he wishes. In this case, they have to apply to the
insurance company in the prescribed form and get it endorsed on the
original policy. In case there are two or more nominees, a joint
discharge has to be given by all the nominees. Ram had nominated his son
Suresh in his insurance policy. However, Suresh died, a month ago so now
Ram needs to nominate some other person in his family as nominee as per
Section 39 of the Insurance Act. This will ensure that there arise no
disputes at the point of claim settlement.</p>
<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p>Assigning a policy transfers all the rights, title and
interest on the insurance policy to the persons in whose favour the
policy is assigned. It is similar to transferring the policy in the
assignee&rsquo;s name. Assignment could be absolute or conditional. In
conditional assignment, the rights come back to the policyholder once
the specified condition is fulfilled while in absolute assignment, the
rights stay with the assignee absolutely till they themselves wish to
assign it back to the original assignor by way of re-assignment. David,
a policyholder, had taken a housing loan from a bank and had absolutely
assigned his insurance policy in favour of the bank. However, when
Aniket died of an accident, the proceeds of the death claim were paid to
the bank to the extent of the outstanding loan and the balance amount
was paid to the legal heir/ beneficiary of the deceased life-assured(
David ,in this case)</p>
<h2 id="33-waiver-of-evidence-of-title">3.3 Waiver of evidence of title</h2>
<p>A valid nomination is adequate title. If
any person challenges the nomination and makes a claim, that person is
advised to obtain orders from a competent Court. In case there is no
nomination, the claimant will have to prove their title. This is done
through legal procedures like obtaining succession certificates. If a
will has been left by the policyholder, the will has to be probated
(validated) by a Court of law, before it can be acted upon. A &lsquo;Will&rsquo; can
be challenged by persons who are aggrieved. Insurers usually do not get
involved in such disputes.</p>
<p>Procurement of succession certificate or probate of Will takes time. In
case of death claims, there could be an urgent need for money. Easy
liquidity is the benefit of a life insurance policy. The claimant could
be in mental and financial distress. In order to facilitate the claim
settlement, even when there is no nomination or assignment, insurers
sometimes subject to certain conditions agree to waive strict legal
proof of title and pay the claim on the strength of an indemnity bond,
particularly if the sum assured is not much. While doing so, they try to
confirm that: There is no dispute among the heirs or relatives, as
regards to the title to the policy moneys. The deceased has not left a
will or any other estate besides the insurance policy/policies, for
which evidence of title may be required to be obtained from a court. The
amount payable under all policies is not very large. Depending upon the
amount payable, the claim may be paid to all the natural heirs on the
basis of a joint discharge and indemnity bond. The natural heirs vary
depending upon the religion of the deceased. As far as Hindus, Sikhs or
Jains are concerned, the widow, mother, sons and daughters and sons and
daughters of each predeceased daughter form the natural or Class I
heirs. The implications of personal laws and local custom have to be
verified.</p>
<h2 id="34-claim-concession">3.4 Claim Concession</h2>
<p>Strictly, if premiums are not paid, the policy
lapses and no further payments would be due under the policy. Therefore,
no claim can be entertained on a lapsed policy. However, insurers do
take a liberal and humane view in these matters. E.g.: The LIC of India
allows the following privileges or concessions: Claims Concession: If
under a policy at least three full years&rsquo; premium is paid and if the
subsequent premium remains unpaid and the death claim arises within six
months of the first unpaid premium, the claim is settled in full, as if
the policy had remained in full force. Extended claims concession:
Similarly, if under a policy at least five full years&rsquo; premium is paid
and if the subsequent premium remains unpaid and the death claim arises
within twelve months of the first unpaid premium, the claim is settled
in full, as if the policy had remained in full force. Note: In both the
above cases, the policy monies will be paid after deducting the
outstanding premiums with interest thereon and the premiums falling due
till the next anniversary of the policy.</p>
<h2 id="35-presumption-of-death">3.5 Presumption of death</h2>
<h2 id="adequate-proof-of-death">Adequate proof of death:</h2>
<p>Following documents
are considered adequate proof of death:</p>
<p>In case of natural death In case of death by accident while travelling
by air or rail or natural calamities In case person is missing while on
board a ship</p>
<p>A death certificate from the Municipality or other competent body, a
certificate of cremation or burial can also be obtained Certificate from
the concerned carrier or any other organisation or authority having
relevant information, if body not found Certificate of the captain of
the ship / shipping company</p>
<h2 id="presumed-to-be-dead">Presumed to be dead</h2>
<p>Sometimes, a person is reported missing without any
information about their whereabouts. The Indian Evidence Act provides
for presumption of death in case a person has not been heard of for 7
years. If a nominee or assignee or a legal heir contends that the life
assured must be presumed to be dead, it would be wise to ask for a
decree (an official order) from the competent court that the assured
should be presumed dead. It is necessary that premiums are paid till the
date of decree presuming death of the life assured.</p>
<p>In case of maturity claims, if it is reported that the insured person
had been missing for some time, the claim will continue to be a maturity
claim and not a death claim till the death is proved. However, since the
title is with the insured person, any other person like an heir to claim
the policy proceeds, death will have to be proved. The procedure will be
the same as for presuming death.</p>
<p>The insurer may consider payment of a claim in case of presumed death,
even within 7 years, if circumstantial evidence is available to show
that the life assured would not have survived a fatal accident or
hazard.</p>
<p>The insurer may also settle the claim on getting an Indemnity Bond to
protect its interest, in case the presumption of death is later found to
be wrong. When the insurer takes the responsibility for such action on
its own, without a decree from a court, there is a risk that some other
claimant to the estate may raise a challenge later. The insurer will not
be able to avoid getting involved in the dispute and having to defend
its action.</p>

security, when loans are taken from banks? Nominee Bank Policyholder

<h2 id="and-post-maturity-options-learning-outcome-d">4. Understand Accidental Death Benefit, Permanent Disability Benefit
and post maturity options [Learning Outcome d]</h2>
<h2 id="41-insurance-riders">4.1 Insurance Riders</h2>
<p>Riders provide additional insurance cover with a basic insurance policy.
A rider is an additional optional benefit with a basic insurance policy.
Insurance companies offer various types of riders, which are useful in
increasing insurance protection by adding a small premium on the basic
policy. The following are the characteristics of riders: Riders are
voluntary and not compulsory. Riders need additional amount of premium.
They are useful for monetary benefits in case certain untoward event
occur. No single rider will have a premium that exceeds the basic
premium of the policy selected.</p>
<p>Although riders call for extra premium, they are better than having
different insurance policies with large premiums.</p>
<p>There are many types of riders, but here, we will discuss only two types
of riders: Accidental Death Benefit (ADB) Permanent Disability Benefit</p>
<h2 id="42-accidental-death-benefit-rider">4.2 Accidental Death Benefit Rider</h2>
<p>Accidents happen by chance, but there
is always a possibility of them. Accidental death is all the more
unfortunate due to its unexpected nature. The family members of the
deceased face critical and financial crisis. In such situations,
Accidental Death Benefit Rider is useful. The premium for this benefit
is nominal. Accident does not only mean a road accident, it can be any
sudden, unpredicted event with violent outward force resulting in an
injury to body or death.</p>
<p>Examples of accidents include snake bite, death in a swimming pool /
river / sea, death due to lightning, electric shock etc.</p>
<p>Diagram 2: Conditions when Accidental Death Benefit Rider claim will
generally be paid:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Policy_claims_111.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Diagram 3: Conditions when Accidental Death Benefit Rider claim
generally would not be paid:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Policy_claims_112.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>There is a maximum limit of sum assured up to which the accident death
benefit is made available. Some companies have limits of up to Rs. 10
lakhs, not on each policy but on all policies put together on a single
life. If there is any doubt on the circumstances of the accident,
enquiries similar to those conducted in the case of early claims are
made.</p>
<h2 id="43-permanent-disability-benefit">4.3 Permanent Disability Benefit</h2>
<p>Accidents do not always result in
death. In case of disability, the policyholder is unable to earn their
normal livelihood. They become a burden on the family. In such
situations, Permanent Disability Benefit is useful. It is neither a
death claim nor a maturity claim. The policy does not end with the
settlement.</p>
<p>A series of seizures (strokes) disabled Parmeet and ended his working
life. However, disability insurance came to his aid and Parmeet got some
financial compensation for the disability. Although unable to work,
Parmeet got the required assistance from disability insurance and was
able to support himself and his family.</p>
<h2 id="some-of-the-benefits-available-under-permanent-disability-benefit">Some of the benefits available under Permanent Disability Benefit</h2>
<p>The following benefits are available in the case of permanent disability
benefit: An additional sum equal to the sum assured, payable in
instalments over a specified period of years, say 10 years. The future
premiums are waived. In the case of death or maturity claims within the
specified period,, the remaining disability benefit instalments have to
be paid within the specified period, along with the claim. The maximum
limit and the exclusion clauses are the same as those under accident
benefit. Interpretation of disability The word &lsquo;disability&rsquo; has
different interpretations and may differ between products of one
insurance company to another. Disability here means disability in
physical terms.</p>
<p>Diagram 4: Disability</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Policy_claims_113.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Examples of permanent disability are loss of vision in both eyes,
amputation of both hands at or above the wrist, amputation of both legs
at or above the ankles etc.</p>
<p>It is necessary that disability must be total and permanent and such
that the life assured would not be able to do any work to earn a
livelihood. (This definition can vary from one insurer to another)</p>
<p>Lalit, a neuro surgeon, met with a major car accident at the age of 40.
His adverse medical condition left him unable to work; inspite of long
drawn treatment but disability insurance cover helped him sustain his
family inspite of him unable to get back to work.</p>
<h2 id="44-post-maturity-option">4.4 Post Maturity Option</h2>
<p>Some insurers offer policyholders an option to
collect the maturity benefit amount in instalments over a period of
years. This option is also known as the settlement option. The option
may be exercised at the commencement or at any time during the term of a
policy. Alternatively, the policyholder can opt for part of the benefit
amount being paid in monthly instalments over a selected period and a
lump sum at the end thereof.</p>
<h2 id="45-precautions">4.5 Precautions</h2>
<p>Following are the points to be noted: A person declared
as &ldquo;lunatic&rdquo; is not competent to enter into any legal transactions and
therefore not competent to sign a contract. If the nominee or
beneficiary as per the probated Will is a lunatic, a guardian of that
person has to sign on his behalf. Payments of claims to non-residents
will have to comply with the Foreign Exchange Regulations. If the policy
had been financed through an HUF (Hindu Undivided Family) fund, the
money will have to be paid to the Karta of the HUF. Furthermore, the
IRDA Regulations require that: The insurer should ask for the
requirements in case of death claim at one time, and not as piecemeal.
The decision to admit or to repudiate a claim should be made within 30
days of receipt of all papers. Investigations ,if necessary should be
completed within 6 months Interest at 2% above the saving bank interest
rate will be payable for delays in settling claims. Interest at the bank
savings account rate will be paid if there is delay on the part of the
claimant.</p>
<p>Question 4 In claim settlement cases, in how many months should the
investigations be completed? 3 months 6 months 9 months None of the
above</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A demand on the insurer to fulfil its promise as per the terms
and conditions of the policy is called a &ldquo;policy claim&rdquo;. In an insurance
company, there are three types of claims &ndash; claim by maturity, claim by
periodic survival benefit payments and death claim. A maturity claim is
payable as per the terms of the contract, at the end of the term of the
policy, if the life assured lives up to that date. The payment by the
insurance company of the assured amount in case the insured dies, is
called death claim. Claims arising within two years of the date of
commencement or revival are termed &ldquo;early death claims&rdquo;. Claims arising
more than two years after the date of risk commencement or revival or
reinstatement are &ldquo;non-early death claims&rdquo;. Early death claims are
investigated before settlement for ascertaining the genuineness of the
claim pay-out Proof of title of the claimant claiming the policy money
is important so that the benefits are paid to the person who is legally
entitled to receive payment. Claim concession is a concession given to
those policyholders who keep the policy in force for at least a
specified period as mentioned in the policy (3 years by LIC of India) A
missing person will be presumed to be dead after seven years subject to
certain conditions as per Indian Evidence Act. Riders are useful to help
increase insurance protection by adding a small premium on the basic
policy. Insurers offer policyholders an option to collect the claim
amount in instalments over a period of years.</p>
