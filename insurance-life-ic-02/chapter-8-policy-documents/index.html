<h2 id="policy-documents">POLICY DOCUMENTS</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter aims to provide you
with an understanding of the importance of the insurance document. Each
different section of the policy document has a different purpose and it
is important to be able to understand the sections and their purposes.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Understand the importance of the policy document and the information
contained in it.</p>
<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this scenario</h2>
<p>Parties enter into agreements, and details
relating to these agreements are documented in what is known as a
contract. Life insurance is no different from any other agreement. Two
parties agree to certain conditions based on details provided. A life
insurance policy is a contract, with two parties (proposer and the life
insurance company) agreeing on their duties and obligations to each
other and the terms and conditions of the agreement (including payment).
These details are documented in the life insurance policy document.
Imagine what would happen if a customer took out a life insurance policy
and paid the premium but received no documentation in return. It would
be confusing, not only trying to prove who does and who doesn&rsquo;t have a
policy but also under what terms and conditions the policy is effective.
At the time of claim it will be difficult to have the claim paid without
proof of the agreement. The policy document is an evidence of the
insurance contract. The document contains the subject matter and the
terms and conditions of the insurance. It sets out the rights, duties
and obligations of both the insurance company and the policyholder.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-a">Understand the importance of the policy document and the information

[Learning Outcome a]</h2>
<h2 id="11-format-of-the-document">1.1 Format of the document</h2>
<p>All life insurance policy documents have a similar format. This is because
the format and wordings have been developed over many years. The
wordings used in the document may appear legalistic so some insurers
also issue a small supplement in addition to the policy, which explains
the main content of the policy in simple terms. In order for the policy
document to be enforced in a court of law, it must be signed and stamped
as per the Stamp Act. In the case of Postal Life Insurance (PLI) the
policy is exempt from stamp duty. The majority of the standard terms and
conditions are printed on the document. Special clauses that are
relevant to a particular contract are attached to the policy document
and form part of the contract.</p>
<p>A policy document is usually divided into various sections as shown
below: Diagram 1: Sections of a policy document</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Policy_document_81.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="12-policy-preamble-operative-clause-and-proviso">1.2 Policy preamble, operative clause and proviso</h2>
<h2 id="operative-clause">Preamble Policy documents generally begin with a paragraph which states that: the
insurer has received a proposal with a personal statement and the first
instalment of premium the insurer agrees to grant the insurance cover
(promise to pay the specified sum should the specified event occur) on
the terms stipulated in the policy document
it is understood and agreed that the insurance cover was granted on the
basis of the statements made in the proposal and personal statements
signed by the proposer the insurance cover is subject to the proposer
paying the premiums as specified in the policy document by the due
dates. The opening paragraph is called the preamble and makes the
proposal and declarations signed by the proposer part of the contract.
The truth of the statements made in the documents is secured to be
warranties. If untrue statements were made in the documents the contract
becomes null and void.
Operative Clause</h2>
<p>The operative clause is
contained in the preamble. This clause details the mutual obligations of
the insurance company and the insured. The policyholder has to pay the
premiums as they are stipulated in the policy. The insurer has to pay
the benefits, as promised, when one of the specified events occurs. The
benefits include bonus additions, if specified. The payment of a benefit
is subject to the policyholder providing proof of the following: the
happening of the event the age of the life insured the title or right of
the person claiming payment</p>
<h2 id="proviso">Proviso</h2>
<p>The preamble also includes the proviso which clarifies that the
following are part of the policy: the terms and conditions printed on
the policy document the endorsements placed on it It is called the
proviso because the contract is conditional on these terms. The normal
terms and conditions are printed on the document. Any changes to these
terms and conditions will be clarified through endorsements. The content
of the endorsements will have been determined when the proposal was
underwritten and the policyholder must be advised of them and accept
them. With the consent of both the policyholder and insurer, changes can
be made after the issue of the policy.</p>
<h2 id="13-schedule">1.3 Schedule</h2>
<p>The schedule contains the specific particulars relating to
the insurance contract, which the policy document is evidence of. The
schedule follows the preamble and includes the following details: policy
number name and address of the proposer and the life insured date of
proposal date of birth and age of life insured commencement date of the
insurance plan and term sum assured mode of payment (yearly, half
yearly, quarterly or monthly) and due dates installment premium date of
last payment of premium name of the nominee (if nominee specified in the
proposal) date of maturity conditions and privileges not applicable
additional or special conditions All the particulars of the subject
matter of the insurance are detailed in the schedule. It identifies the
proposal that is referred to in the preamble.</p>

<h2 id="14-attestation">1.4 Attestation</h2>
<p>The attestation is the signature on behalf of the
insurer. It appears at the end of the first page of the policy. If
insurers provide a supplementary contract for additional benefits,
provided through riders, the supplementary contract will be attested
separately.</p>

law, it must be signed and stamped as per which Act? The Insurance Act

<h2 id="learning-outcome-b">Understand conditions and privileges in an insurance policy.
[Learning Outcome b]</h2>
<h2 id="21-conditions-and-privileges">2.1 Conditions and privileges</h2>
<p>There are four types of policy
conditions and privileges. These are: explanatory conditions: they
clarify the conditions of the policy restrictive conditions: these limit
the scope of the assurance privileges: these add to the benefits of the
insurance and provide privileges supplementary benefits: these provide
extended or supplementary benefits Explanatory conditions are for the
insured&rsquo;s information; they clarify the policy conditions. For example,
there would be a condition that if the policyholder did not pay the
premium by the due date or if any of the information provided by the
policyholder on the proposal, personal statement or declaration was
untrue, then the policy would be null and void and all benefits under
the policy will cease; any premiums paid will also be forfeited as per
the Insurance Act 1938.</p>
<p>An explanatory condition on a policy document would be a clause that
advises the insured, that should death occur, any premium instalments
due for the remaining part of the policy year will be deducted from the
claim amount.</p>
<p>Restrictive conditions are designed to eliminate certain risks that are
not taken into account when determining the premium. If any such risk is
incurred, the assurance is limited to the payment of the surrender
value, or the return of premiums or a proportion of the sum assured as
stated in the conditions. These restrictive conditions are decided by
the underwriter and have to be agreed by the policyholder.</p>
<p>One common restriction on all policies is that no claim will be paid if
the life assured commits suicide in the first year, except to the extent
of a third party&rsquo;s bonafide beneficial interest. This restriction
normally operates for one year from the commencement of the policy. In
some countries the suicide clause operates for two years from the date
of issue of the policy. Accident benefit is never paid in the case of a
suicide. In some types of policies there is a condition that no loans
are payable.</p>
<p>Restrictions are generally not imposed based on hazardous occupations
but extra premium is charged to cover the extra risk to which the life
insured is exposed to due to their occupation. One such example is an
occupation in aviation. Double accident and disability benefit are not
available in the event of death as a result of an accident while the
life insured is engaged in aviation, unless they are a passenger on a
commercial airline. Some insurers require that they be notified of a
change of occupation and failure to do so may invalidate the accident
benefits or other benefits secured through riders. In some policies,
foreign travel and residence may be a restriction. In India, the LIC
policy is free from restrictions for travel and residence. Some
insurance companies exclude coverage in the event of death within 5
years or as a result of war, while travelling outside the country. The
LIC insurance policies used to exclude deaths occurring as a result of
war. Now they are free from war restrictions, except for double accident
benefits.</p>
<h2 id="22-conditions-which-add-to-the-benefits-of-the-insurance-and-privileges">2.2 Conditions which add to the benefits of the insurance and privileges</h2>
<p>If the provisions of the contract as stated on the first page were
strictly adhered to, it would make the contract very rigid and
restrictive for the policyholder. For example, failure to pay premiums
on or before the due date would result in complete forfeiture of the
insurance. To reduce the severity of the contract some policy conditions
(privileges) are inserted. Diagram 3: Policy conditions (privileges):</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Policy_document_83.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>All the above privileges are discussed in detail later in the book.</p>
<h2 id="23-conditions-which-provide-extended-or-supplementary-benefits">2.3 Conditions which provide extended or supplementary benefits</h2>
<p>These are the benefits that are covered by riders. They may be incorporated in
the policy document as policy conditions or they may be mentioned as
riders, while the policy document deals with the standard terms and
conditions. Previously, companies had separate policy document formats
for: policies with accident benefits policies without accident benefits
policies which participate in profits policies which do not participate
in profits</p>
<p>These formats were printed and kept in inventory. With the increased
availability and use of computers it is no longer necessary to keep
these expensive inventories. Any combination of conditions can be
immediately incorporated and printed. Some insurers&rsquo; policy documents
refer to the additional benefits; and the benefits as such are detailed
in separate forms which are annexures or addenda to the policy. This is
similar to having separate endorsements. The insurance policy is divided
into four parts after the preamble. These parts are: part 1: contains
the schedule part 2: provides the details of the benefits payable
(amounts, relevant events, limitations, exclusions, bonuses, guaranteed
additions etc.), including the benefits under the riders. This part also
explains the policyholders&rsquo; rights to commute or accumulate in part or
in full, the instalments due to them part 3: provides details of the
terms and conditions relating to age, admission, lapse, non-forfeiture,
revival, loans, surrender values, assignments, nominations, exclusions
etc. related to suicide and documents required for making claims part 4:
gives the amount of guaranteed surrender value</p>
<p>Question 2 Which of the following are the conditions that are designed
to eliminate certain risks? Explanatory Extended Supplementary
Restrictive</p>
<h2 id="24-alteration">2.4 Alteration</h2>
<p>The policy document embodies the terms of the contract
and these terms continue throughout the period of the policy. No changes
can be made unless they are agreed to by both the policyholder and the
insurer. There may be situations where the policyholder requests a
change in the terms of the contract if their circumstances change. An
example of this may be where a policyholder requests a reduction in the
sum assured as they are finding it difficult to pay the premium for the
original sum assured, or they may ask to change the mode of payment. The
types of alterations which may be requested are: alterations in plan or
term reduction in sum assured change in mode of payment of premium
alteration of name change of nominee removal of an extra premium
splitting the policy into two or more policies alteration from a without
profit plan to a with profit plan and vice versa grant of accident
benefits settlement option of payment of sum assured in instalments
grant of premium waiver benefits correction in policies &ndash; usually done
soon after commencement of policy Alterations are considered if the
policy is in force for the full sum assured. Normally alterations are
not allowed for the first year of the policy unless they are done for a
correction or a change which does not affect the basic insurance
contract, such as changes in address or change in nominee An insured has
a life insurance policy which he has held for 3 years. They have paid
their premiums quarterly during this time and now wish to pay the
premiums annually. This change would require an alteration to the
current policy as the time of payment of premium is changing from
quarterly to yearly. The insurer must try to ensure that there will be
no adverse selection against them when they consider a request for
alteration. Adverse selection means the change should not increase the
risk.</p>
<p>Alterations which increase the risk are: increasing the sum assured
increasing the term change of insurance plan e.g. conversion of term
plan to whole life plan Alterations are generally not allowed if they
involve: change to a longer term extending the premium paying period
changing from one plan of insurance to another that represents increased
risk Some alterations are made by having a suitable endorsement on the
policy itself. If the alterations are substantial, a new policy may be
issued. This will happen if a policy is being split into two or more
policies, incorporating the desired alterations. Unless an alteration is
to correct a mistake, a fee is usually charged to effect the alteration.
Alterations in frequency of payment from quarterly to half yearly or
yearly reduces the administrative work in servicing the policy so no fee
is charged. Charging a fee has two purposes: to cover expenses in an
attempt to discourage frequency of alterations</p>
<h2 id="25-duplicate">2.5 Duplicate</h2>
<p>Policies Because of the long duration of a life insurance policy, it is possible
that policy documents are misplaced or lost, maybe if the policyholder
moves to another place or re-arranges their personal belongings. Policy
documents may also be damaged due to moisture or termites. Lost or
damaged policy documents do not absolve the insurer of their liability
to pay the policy moneys when a claim arises. Even without the policy
documentation the claim must be paid to the claimant. A policy document
represents property and as such a policyholder may require the document
for making an assignment or pledging it against a loan. Insurers issue
duplicate policies at the request of the policyholder, however, they do
this with caution as they do not want to become a participant in any
wrong doing which may be attempted. It is possible that a policyholder
may report their policy document as lost or stolen to the insurer, when
they have mortgaged or assigned the document to someone else. Although
these attempts at fraud may be few, precautions are necessary in all
cases. Therefore, insurers make enquiries to satisfy themselves that the
reported loss is genuine.</p>
<p>Before a duplicate policy is issued, a policyholder may be asked to
advertise in the local newspaper or provide an indemnity bond signed by
the policyholder as surety. If the policy is stolen the policyholder
will have to file a first information report (FIR) with the police and
obtain the final investigation report from the police. If a policy
document is partially burnt, mutilated or damaged, the remains of the
document may be examined and if the identity is clear a duplicate policy
can be issued without advertisement and indemnity bond. The policyholder
will have to pay the costs associated with issuing a duplicate policy,
which includes advertisement (if required) and stamp duty. The duplicate
policy document is clearly stamped with a rubber stamp to indicate that
it is a duplicate policy; however, the duplicate is as good as the
original document for all practical purposes. The duplicate policy will
have all the same endorsements as the original and will be signed and
stamped by the insurer with the original date on it.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In order for the policy document to be enforced in a court of
law, it must be signed and stamped as per the Stamp Act. Some
alterations are made by having a suitable endorsement on the policy
itself. If the alterations are substantial a new policy may be issued.
The attestation is the signature on behalf of the insurer. The opening
paragraph is called the preamble and makes the proposal and declarations
signed by the proposer part of the contract. The preamble includes the
proviso and the operative clause. The schedule contains the specific
particulars relating to the insurance contract such as the name and
address of the policyholder or the life insured, plan and term, sum
assured and mode of payment. No changes can be made to the policy unless
they are agreed upon by both the policyholder and the insurer. The
insurer must try to ensure that there will be no adverse selection
against them when they consider a request for alteration. A duplicate
policy document is clearly stamped with a rubber stamp to indicate that
it is a duplicate policy; however, the duplicate is as good as the
original document for all practical purposes. Explanatory conditions are
for the insured&rsquo;s information, and clarify the policy conditions.
Restrictive conditions are designed to eliminate certain risks that are
not taken into account when determining the premium.</p>

untrue, then the policy would be null and void, all benefits under the
policy will cease and any premiums paid will be forfeited If death takes
place, the instalments of premium due for the remainder of the policy
period will be deducted from the claim amount.</p>
<h2 id="answers-to-self-examination-questions">Answers to Self-Examination Questions</h2>
<p>Answer 1 The correct option is D.
Attestation is the signature on behalf of the insurer.</p>
<p>Answer 2 The correct answer is C. The preamble includes the proviso and
the operative clause.</p>
<p>Answer 3 The correct answer is D. The preamble makes the proposal and
declaration signed by the policyholder part of the contract.</p>
<p>Answer 4 The correct answer is C. A change in the policyholder&rsquo;s place
of residence would not increase the risk to the insurer. Answer 5 The
correct answer is A. A restrictive condition eliminates risk from the
insurance contract, therefore, the condition that no claim will be paid
if the life insured commits suicide is a restrictive condition. The
other conditions are all examples of explanatory conditions.</p>
