<meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER 10 ASSIGNMENT, NOMINATION AND SURRENDER OF POLICY Chapter Introduction Insurance companies have diversified, and introduced insurance products that can cater to each and every financial need of an individual. When an individual invests in an insurance policy they are actually investing in a long term asset. This asset not only provides insurance cover and returns on the investment, but can also be used to avail loan in times of financial crunch." />

<h2 id="assignment-nomination-and-surrender-of-policy">ASSIGNMENT, NOMINATION AND SURRENDER OF POLICY</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>Insurance companies have diversified, and introduced insurance products
that can cater to each and every financial need of an individual. When
an individual invests in an insurance policy they are actually investing
in a long term asset. This asset not only provides insurance cover and
returns on the investment, but can also be used to avail loan in times
of financial crunch. In this chapter we will discuss the loan facility
and surrender benefits offered by insurance products, which provide
sufficient liquidity to a policyholder. We will also discuss the
nomination and assignment facilities available under a life insurance
policy.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Learn about assignment of insurance policies. Learn about the nomination
feature and its importance. Understand the concept of surrender of an
insurance policy. Learn about loans and foreclosures against insurance
policies.</p>
<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this scenario</h2>
<p>Rajeev Tandon is a small businessman who owns a
grocery shop. He wishes to purchase a house for which he is looking for
various home loan options. He lives in a rented apartment and does not
want to offer his shop as collateral as it is the main source of his
livelihood. He is wondering what other option he has. He discusses his
problem with the insurance agent who informs him that he can assign a
policy in favour of the bank and take a loan with the insurance policy
as a collateral .He could also avail of a loan under his insurance
policy if the insurance product has this facility. In this chapter we
will see how the insured can take a loan against the insurance policy by
assigning the policy in favour of the insurance company or the bank.</p>
<h2 id="1-learn-about-assignment-of-insurance-policies-learning-outcome-a">1. Learn about assignment of insurance policies. [Learning Outcome a]</h2>
<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p>The process of transferring the title, rights and interest on
assets or property from one person to another is known as assignment.
Assignment is generally done to provide security against loan. The
person or policyholder who transfers the title on the assets or property
is known as the assignor and the person to whom the title on the assets
or property is transferred is known as the assignee.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-assignment">Features of assignment</h2>
<p>Assignment can be done only after the purchase of
a policy. Assignment is applicable to all kinds of insurance plans
except pension plans and plans under Married Women&rsquo;s Property (MWP) Act.
Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938 deals with assignment of insurance
policy. Assignment may be made with or without consideration. Assignor
should be a major and competent to contract. Assignor should have
complete ownership of the policy. The life assured, if minor or if not
the policyholder or proposer, does not have any rights over the policy,
hence cannot assign the policy. Only the proposer or policyholder can
make an assignment. In the case of child plans, when the life assured
(child) becomes a major and the title passes to him, he can make an
assignment.</p>
<p>After assignment the assignee gets complete ownership and rights over
the insurance policy. He can even surrender the policy. The assignee
also gets the legal right to sue under the policy. Assignment can be
done towards a person or an institution. There can be more than one
assignee. In this case, each assignee will acquire the rights on the
insurance policy as &rsquo;tenants&rsquo; in common. This means that each assignee
has an undivided and specific interest in common with the other
assignees. If one of the tenants dies his interest does not pass on to
his cotenants, but gets transferred to his legal heirs. Insurer has to
record the fact of the assignment in their records. Assignment once made
cannot be cancelled. Policy can be re-assigned in the name of the life
insured.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-assignment">Types of assignment:</h2>
<p>There are two types of assignments: Conditional
assignment: in this type of assignment, the rights, title and interest
in the policy automatically revert back to the assignor on the
occurrence of the specified conditions as mentioned below: on the death
of the assignee before the death of the assignor the assignor survives
the date of maturity of the insurance policy the loan is repaid The
consent of the assignee need not be taken for reversion of the policy if
the condition becomes effective. It is automatic. A person who takes a
home loan from a bank can pledge their insurance policy (if any) to the
bank as a collateral security against the loan. In this case the bank
will be the assignee and the policyholder will be the assignor. The
policyholder or assignor will continue to pay the premium, while the
assignee (bank) gets the financial rights on the insurance policy,
including the death benefit. The condition in this will specify that the
bank will be entitled to benefit from the policy only to the extent of
the outstanding loan. The balance amount of the claim amount is returned
to the legal heirs of the deceased policyholder (in case the policy
holder dies before repaying the loan) Absolute assignment: in this type
of assignment the rights, title and interest of the assignor passes
completely to the assignee. Absolute assignment is generally done for
valuable consideration. The policy vests in the assignee absolutely and
forms part of his estate on his death.</p>
<p>Diagram 1: Types of assignment</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Assignment_nomination_and_surrender_of_policy_101.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="process-of-assignment">Process of assignment</h2>
<p>The assignment can be done by either of the
following process: Making an endorsement on the policy document: in this
process stamp duty is not required. The assignment form along with the
policy should be duly signed by the assignor, assignee and a witness.
Executing a separate assignment deed: in this case stamp duty needs to
be paid. The assignment will be effective w.r.t. the insurer only if it
is registered with the insurer in their records. The date on which the
notice of assignment is delivered to the insurer shall regulate the
priority of all claims under a transfer or assignment.</p>
<p>Question 1 In which of the following types of assignment does the
assignee become the owner of the policy? Conditional assignment Absolute
assignment Endorsement assignment Separate assignment</p>
<h2 id="learn-about-the-nomination-feature-and-its-importance-learning-outcome-b">Learn about the nomination feature and its importance. [Learning Outcome b]</h2>
<h2 id="nomination">Nomination</h2>
<p>Nomination is the right provided to the
policyholder to appoint a certain person, who will receive the benefits
of the policy in case of the policyholder&rsquo;s death during the policy
term. In case the life assured survives till the date of maturity, the
nomination will be treated as cancelled automatically. The person to
become entitled to the benefits of the insurance policy on the death of
the insured is known as the nominee. There can be more than one nominees
appointed by the policyholder. This is a simple method for speedy
settlement of death claims.</p>
<h2 id="process-of-nomination">Process of nomination:</h2>
<p>Nomination can be done by either of the following
methods: At the time of proposal: at the proposal stage, the
policyholder needs to fill up the nomination column in the proposal
form, with complete details of the nominee such as: name of the nominee
age address relationship between nominee and the policyholder etc The
information regarding the name and relationship of the insured with the
nominee is included in the schedule of the policy. If sufficient space
is not available in the form, then nomination can be mentioned on a
separate piece of paper and pasted on the policy document and the life
assured needs to sign at the edges where the slip is attached to the
policy. This may also be needed when nomination is to be changed through
an endorsement. After the commencement of the policy: a notice for
nomination is served to the insurer by the policyholder, or life assured
(in case the policyholder and the life assured are different
persons).The insurer will then register the same in their records.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-nomination">Features of Nomination:</h2>
<p>Section 39 of the Insurance Act 1938 deals with
nomination of insurance policies. Nomination can be revoked or cancelled
anytime by the policyholder of a policy on his own life during the term
of the policy. If the policyholder and the insured person in an
insurance policy are two different people, then in this case the
policyholder cannot appoint nominee(s) The nominee cannot influence the
policy in any way. He will be entitled to the benefits of the policy
only if the death of the life assured during the term of the policy.
There can be more than one nominees appointed by the life assured. In
case of death of one of the nominees before the death of the life
assured during the term of the policy only the surviving nominees as on
the date of death of the life assured will be paid the death benefit.
The nominee does not get the title to the death claim. He has to hold
the benefits of the death claim, on behalf of the legal heirs of the
life assured. The legal heirs need to be determined on the basis of
their relationships with the life assured. If a will is presented, the
people mentioned in the will become entitled to the death claim. If the
nominee dies after the death of the policyholder but before death claim
settlement, then the policy moneys would form part of life assureds'
estate and his legal representatives will be paid the death claim. In
policies where the maturity amount is payable in installments, the
remaining installments are paid to the nominees. On assignment of the
policy, nomination automatically gets cancelled. However, an assignment
made in favour of the insurer for loan granted against the security of
the policy does not cancel the nomination.</p>
<h2 id="if-the-nominee-is-a-minor">If the nominee is a minor:</h2>
<p>If the nominee appointed is a minor, then in this case the life assured
needs to duly appoint an appointee, who is a major. The appointee has to
duly sign the document to confirm that he consents to fulfil the duties
of an appointee. The life assured can change the appointee at any time
during the policy term. When the minor turns major, the appointee loses
his status. In case the nominee appointed is minor and no appointee has
been appointed, then the proceeds of the death claim will go to the
legal heirs of the deceased.</p>

<h2 id="understand-the-concept-of-surrender-of-an-insurance-policy-learning-outcome-c">Understand the concept of surrender of an insurance policy. [Learning Outcome c]</h2>
<p>Surrender of insurance policy A life insurance policy can be
withdrawn before maturity, and this process is known as &lsquo;surrender of
policy&rsquo;. The amount payable to the policyholder once the insurance
policy is surrendered is known as surrender value or cash value.
Insurance companies provide the surrender feature in a policy to
overcome the biggest disadvantage of insurance policies which is
&rsquo;liquidity&rsquo;. Hence in case of financial emergencies, a policyholder has
the option to surrender his policy and withdraw the benefits, subject to
certain conditions applicable under the policy. Insurance companies
generally provide detailed data regarding surrender value for different
years within the term of the policy. Surrender value could be a
guaranteed amount by the insurance company, although the actual
surrender may be better than the guaranteed surrender value from the
guaranteed one. The rules for surrender of ULIP&rsquo;s are bound by a
different set of rules.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-surrender">Features of Surrender:</h2>
<p>Surrender value is usually a percentage of
premiums paid or a percentage of the paid up value. The higher the
policy term, the lower is the surrender value factor. It does not depend
on the actual premium or the mode of premium. The percentage called the
surrender value factor (S.V. Factor) increases as the duration of the
policy since commencement increases. If there are two policies: &lsquo;A&rsquo; for
a 15 year term and &lsquo;B&rsquo; for a 20 year term, then the surrender value
factor after 10 years will be more for policy A than for policy B. The
surrender value factor increases with an increase in the policy period.</p>
<p>The surrender value of a certain policy after 15 years will be more than
that of the same policy after 10 years.</p>
<p>Surrender value of the policy is kept low by insurance companies during
the early term of the policy. There are two reasons for this: The
premium collected in the early years is not credited to the policy
account like a bank account, but a part of it is used for payment of
death claims that may arise. Insurance companies try to discourage early
surrender of the policy. If the surrenders in the early years are made
attractive. an individual would prefer to surrender the policy in case
he faces economic difficulties. The healthier lives are more likely to
surrender their policies than the unhealthy ones, distorting the
expected averages of the experience of the pool of policy-holders i.e.
this could lead to an adverse selection.</p>
<p>Question 3 For which of the following insurance plans will the surrender
value factor be the highest after three years from inception (if the sum
assured of all the four policies is the same)? The insurance plan for 10
years The insurance plan for 15 years The insurance plan for 20 years
The insurance plan for 30 years</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-d">Learn about foreclosures and loans against insurance policies.
[Learning Outcome d]</h2>
<p>Loans There are many benefits of purchasing an
insurance policy. One of those benefits is the availability of loans
against an insurance policy. Under this facility, a policyholder can
request for a loan and offer his insurance policy as collateral. The
loan amount will depend upon the total surrender value of the insurance
policy as the loan offered is limited to a certain percentage of
surrender value.</p>
<p>When a loan is taken by the policyholder, the policy gets assigned
absolutely to the insurer. However, nomination continues to be valid
even after the assignment in this case. All insurance products do not
offer the facility of loans.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-loan-against-insurance-policy">Features of loan against insurance policy</h2>
<p>Loan amount: the loan amount
granted against a life insurance policy is generally 90% of its
surrender value. In the case of fully paid up policies, the loan
generally granted up to 85 % of a policy&rsquo;s surrender value. This formula
can vary form one insurance company to another. The rate of interest on
outstanding loan charged is generally paid half-yearly to coincide with
the due date of premium. If the premiums are continued to be paid
regularly, then the surrender value of the policy will continue to
increase, which can be adjusted against the outstanding loan amount and
interest. The minimum period for which the loan can be granted is six
months. If the policyholder wishes to repay the loan before six months,
he will have to pay the loan interest for minimum six months. If the
policyholder dies within six months of taking the loan, the interest
will be charged up to the date of death of the life assured. If the
policy matures within six months of taking a loan under the policy, then
the interest will be charged up to the date of maturity only. The loan
could be repaid during the policy term. The payment of loan can be
delayed and adjusted at the time of death claim. The remaining balance
left after repayment of the loan is paid to the legal heirs of the life
assured.</p>
<h2 id="broken-period">Broken period</h2>
<p>The period between the loan approval date and the
anniversary date of the policy is known as broken period. Generally, if
the date of the anniversary is more than six months away then broken
period will be between the loan approval date and six months prior to
the date of policy anniversary. Interest is charged separately for the
broken period.</p>
<h2 id="additional-loan-against-insurance-policy">Additional loan against insurance policy</h2>
<p>There can be more than one loan
taken by the policyholder during the term of the policy. Additional loan
that is being granted along with previous loan generally does not exceed
90 % (85% for fully paid up policies) of the surrender value. Overdue
interest on previous outstanding loan is deducted while granting
additional loans.</p>
<h2 id="insurance-plans-that-are-not-eligible-for-loan-against-insurance-policies">Insurance plans that are not eligible for loan against insurance policies</h2>
<p>Annuities and pension plans are not eligible for loans as they
do not acquire adequate surrender value. Money back policies are also
not eligible for loan as a part of the sum assured is returned to the
policyholder at periodic intervals. In child plans, loan cannot be
granted during the deferment period (when the child is a minor) Certain
plans of life insurance do not offer a loan facility under certain
products.</p>
<h2 id="foreclosures">Foreclosures</h2>
<p>The process of closing the insurance policy or writing it
off before its maturity date by an insurance company is known as
foreclosure. When a policyholder decides to avail a loan, he has two
choices: repaying the loan amount with interest during the policy term;
or accumulating the loan debt over the policy term, and adjusting it at
the time when claim arises The second option can be exercised only when
the premium has been paid regularly. If there has been default in
premium payment, then it needs to be ensured that the surrender value of
the policy needs to be sufficient enough to meet the arrears of loan and
interest. If the loan amount with interest due is likely to get more
than the surrender value of the policy, foreclosure becomes essential.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-foreclosure">Features of foreclosure</h2>
<p>When the insurance company decides to foreclose
the policy, the policyholder is intimated, and advised to make timely
payment of arrears of interest on loan to avoid foreclosure. If the
default in the repayment continues, then the policy is foreclosed i.e.
policy is surrendered for repayment of the outstanding loan. The balance
surrender value (if any) that remains after the repayment of loan with
interest is paid to the policyholder. Once foreclosure is done,
nomination, if any, will not be valid. If the policyholder dies before
the payment of the balance surrender value, then the payment will be
made to his legal heirs and not the nominees.</p>
<p>Reinstatement of the policy: a foreclosed policy can be reinstated in
following cases: The policyholder is medically fit. Outstanding loan
interest with accumulated interest thereon is paid till date. If the
balance surrender value has been paid to the policyholder, then in this
case the policy cannot be reinstated, as it indicates that the
policyholder had accepted the foreclosure action. Any further request to
revive the policy raises doubts about moral hazard.</p>
<p>Question 4 The minimum duration of a loan against an insurance policy is
of _________ 15 days 3 months 6 months One year</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The process of transferring the right title and interest on
assets or property from one person to another is known as assignment.
Nomination is the right provided to the policyholder to appoint a
certain person, who will receive the benefits under the policy in case
of his death of the lifeassured during the policy term.</p>
<p>The process of withdrawing a life insurance policy before maturity by
the policy-holder is known as surrender. The amount payable to the
policyholder, once the insurance policy is surrendered, is known as the
surrender value. When loan is taken by a policyholder, the policy gets
assigned absolutely to the insurer. The period between the loan approval
date and the anniversary date of the policy is known as the broken
period. The decision regarding foreclosure is taken by the insurance
company if there has been default in loan repayment by the policyholder.</p>
