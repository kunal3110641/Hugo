<meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER 6 LINKED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES Chapter Introduction ULIPs gained a lot of popularity among investors during the bull run of Indian stock markets from 2003 to 2007. During this time period, the BSE Sensex rose from 3000 points to 20,000 points.

<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>ULIPs gained a lot of popularity among investors during the bull run of Indian stock
markets from 2003 to 2007. During this time period, the BSE Sensex rose
from 3000 points to 20,000 points. With the BSE index multiplying six
times over this five year period, the interest of investors in the
capital markets was very high. So keeping in mind the requirements of
the investors, insurance companies came up with various ULIP products
and their variants. The companies which already had ULIPs in their
product portfolio have stepped up the marketing of these products in the
last few years. In fact, ULIPs contributed 50% of the premium collected
of some companies. For some companies, the percentage was much higher
than 50%. ULIPs give the buyer the much needed life insurance protection
and also an option to participate in the growth of the capital market.
In this chapter we will study about ULIPs and their features and compare
them with the other products that are offered by insurance companies.</p>

<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this scenario</h2>
<p>Arnab has earned Rs. 80,000 as annual performance
bonus from his company. He wants to invest this money in some investment
product where he can get good returns. Every day when he hears about BSE
Sensex reaching new levels, his interest in capital market increases.
However he is apprehensive about investing directly in shares as he has
neither the required fundamental knowledge nor the technical expertise
for investing in stock markets. Hence his first choice is mutual funds,
where he can safely handover his money to the expert mutual fund
managers and passively participate in the growth of capital markets. But
his family wants him to start investing in an insurance plan, which they
feel is more essential for meeting any eventualities than investing in
mutual funds. This is where products like ULIPs come in handy for people
like Arnab, as ULIPs offer the twin benefits of participating in the
growth of capital markets along with insurance protection.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-a">3. Understand the concept of ULIPs
[Learning Outcome a]</h2>
<h2 id="introduction-to-ulips">Introduction to ULIPs</h2>
<p>A unit linked insurance plan (ULIP) is an insurance plan which
is a combination of insurance protection and investment. A ULIP can be
an ideal investment vehicle for people who are looking for the triple
benefits of: insurance protection; investment; and income tax benefits
ULIPs or Unit linked insurance plans are market linked insurance plans.
ULIPs come with the combined benefits of investment and protection. With
regard to protection ULIPs are very similar to traditional insurance
plans such as &ndash; endowment, money back and whole life insurance plans,
but with a major difference the investment risks in ULIPs are borne by
the policyholder / investor and not by the insurance company.</p>
<p>Investment operations of ULIPs are very much similar to that of mutual
funds. In fact ULIPS can be referred as mutual funds with insurance
cover. As in mutual funds, in ULIPs too investors are allotted units, by
the insurance company and a NAV is declared on a daily basis. The
premium paid by the insured in a ULIP is divided into 3 parts: Expenses:
a portion of the premium goes towards meeting the expenses of issuing a
policy- like agent&rsquo;s commission, policy set up costs, administrative
costs and statutory levies. This amount is also known as &lsquo;Policy
Allocation Charge (PAC)&rsquo;. Mortality: a portion of the premium goes
towards covering the risk or providing life cover to the life insured
and is the cost of risk cover. Investment: after deducting the above two
amounts, the remaining premium goes towards investment on behalf of the
life insured. The individual is given a choice of funds to select from
and decide where they want their premium to be invested.</p>
<p>Diagram 1: ULIP premium - breakup</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Linked_Like_Insurance_policy_61.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>In linked policies, the death benefit may be expressed as an integrated
benefit, which means that in the event of death, the SA or the value of
units in the funds, whichever is higher, is payable. In this case, the
risk cover will reduce as the value of the units increases. As the risk
cover decreases, the premium adjusted towards the cover will decrease
and the amount allocated to investments will increase. The fund may grow
faster. The alternative or the integrated benefit is to pay a fixed SA
as a benefit on death, in addition to the value of the units in the
funds. In this case, the charge for the risk cover will increase from
year to year, because of age, and the allocation to the fund will
decrease correspondingly.</p>
<p>Some of the other features, offered by insurers along with the ULIPs are
the following. These are not offered by all insurers. They are also not
available with all ULIPs offered by the same insurer. The policyholder
can pay additional premium for investment at any time. Partial or total
withdrawal is allowed. Sometimes there are conditions attached. Some
insurers, not all, charge a redemption fee in such cases. -These
policies will not be entitled to any bonus.</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-funds">Choice of Funds</h2>
<p>The policyholder can select from various funds available to invest their
premium. Generally, the funds in which their moneys are invested are
indicated below the funds are invested in various kinds of instruments,

combinations of the above four funds. Insurance companies have different

Preserver Fund, Maximiser, Multiplier, Gilt Fund, Enhancer, Dynamic

<p>ULIPs have a lock in period of 5 years (since 1 of September 2010).
Earlier, the lock in period used to be 3 years, after which the investor
had the option to withdraw their investment from ULIPs. Since September
2010 the lock in period has been increased by IRDA, to encourage long
term investments and to ensure enhanced benefits as compared to short
term benefits. ULIPs provide a lot of flexibility to the policyholder.
The option of switching in one provision that gives the flexibility.
Policyholders are also allowed to make a lump sum additional
contribution at any time. The amount going into the fund for investment
will increase. Top-up is the expression used to refer to the
policyholder increasing the contribution for investment. There could be
a top-up charge. The IRDA guidelines stipulate that top-up is allowed
only if the regular premiums paid up to date.</p>
<p>It also states that if the top-up amount is more than 25% of the regular
premium paid up-to-date., the life cover will increase by 1.25 times the
excess top-up amount. st There will also by a lock-in-period of five
years ( since 1 of Sept-2010) for each top-up amount, except during the
last five years of the policy. Policy holders may also be allowed to
redirect the current premium into any fund, in any proportion,
irrespective of the fund in which the earlier premiums have been
invested. This facility allows the policyholder to take advantage of the
market conditions, without exercising the switching option.
Policyholders may not pay the premium in a year, subject to certain
conditions. If that happens, no new units will be added to his fund but
some unit will be reduced to pay for the annual charges like for cover,
administration, fund management etc. This is called a premium holiday.
The arrangement can also be terminated at any time and the amount in the
fund withdrawn. The loss will only be a nominal fee. Premium is invested
in various funds, as chosen by the policyholder, by the insurance
company against which, they allot units to the policyholder. The NAV of
a fund represents the net value of the fund on a particular date and
reflects the total value of the assets of that fund, after some
adjustments for expenses. For example, the equity fund comprising of
contribution from many policyholders would have been invested in a
variety of equity shares in the stock market along with other
instruments. The total market value of these shares and other
instruments on an day, divided by the units in that equity fund would be
the NAV for that day, As market values of shares vary, the NAV will keep
varying from day to day. Lock in period is that period which was earlier
3 years now stands raised to 5 years. During this period no withdrawals
are permitted (Refer to IRDA or IRDA/Actl/Cir/ULIP/124/08/2010 dated
04/8/2010 and IRDA/ACT/CIR/ULIP/102/06/2010 dt28/6/2010 given in the
Annexure section of the book) As in traditional policies, additional
benefits are made available through riders which are optional in nature.
Usually riders provide for: accident benefit disability benefit increase
/ decrease in death benefit critical illness rider</p>
<p>major surgical assistance benefit hospital cash benefit spouse insurance
benefit etc Additional premia will have to be paid for these rider
benefits.</p>

<h2 id="how-ulips-work">How ULIPs work</h2>
<p>The concept of ULIPs is very similar to mutual funds. The following
process is involved in ULIP: The premiums are paid by the policyholder
to the insurance company. The premium could be paid either as a lump sum
or at periodic intervals &ndash; monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually.
The insurance company can restrict the premium to be in multiples of Rs.
500 or Rs. 1000. Some companies also stipulate a minimum premium amount
of say Rs. 5000 or Rs. 10,000. The term of the policy has to be a
minimum of 5 years or more.</p>
<p>A certain portion of the premium is deducted by the insurance company to
provide for premium allocation charges and mortality (cost of risk
cover). The remaining premium is invested in funds chosen by the
policyholder. The sum assured or insurance cover, payable on death is
equivalent to a multiple of the annual premium, say 10 times of the
annual premium. The insurance company allots units of various funds
(equity, debt, balanced) as chosen by the individual. These funds are
floated and managed by expert fund managers of insurance companies. Each
time premium is paid, the insurance company allots equivalent units out
of that premium (after deduction expenses) to the policyholder.
Insurance company levies mortality charges and policy administration
charges periodically (normally monthly) by cancellation of units. The
fund management charges (FMC) are adjusted from the NAV on a daily
basis. The policyholder has the choice of transferring his money from
one fund to another e.g. equity to debt or vice versa. This process in
known as Switching. The units are redeemed and equivalent amount is
returned to the policyholder on maturity. In case of premature death of
the insured, the beneficiaries will receive the claim benefit amount
based on the product specifications. Top-up: individuals are allowed to
invest additional amount of money over and above the regular premium
that they are paying. This is known as top-up. The expenses involved in
top-up investments are also lower than the regular premiums paid. As per
regulations, Top up premium once paid cannot be withdrawn from the fund
for a period of 5 years.from the date of payment of topup Top up
premiums are also not permitted during the last 5 years of the contract.
All top up premiums made during the currency of the contract, must have
insurance cover treating them as a single premium, based on guidelines
and formulae stipulated for the same.</p>
<h2 id="net-asset-value-nav">Net Asset Value (NAV)</h2>
<p>The NAV of a fund represents the net value of the
fund on a particular date and reflects the total value of the assets of
that funds, after some adjustments for expenses, For example, the equity
fund comprising of contributions from many policyholders would have been
invested in a variety of equity shares in the stock market along with
other instruments. The total market value of these shares and other
instruments on an day, divided by the units in that equity fund would be
the NAV for that day, As market values, of shares vary, the NAV will
keep varying from day to day. The NAV becomes the basis for new entrants
and for exists from the funds, For example, if a new policy holder
wishes to have Rs 10000 invested in an equity fund and on that
particular day, the NAV of that fund is Rs 20. He will be allotted 500
units (the nominal cost of each being Rs.20) from that fund. When he
wishes to exit from that fun, because of switching or final termination
of the contract, he will get 500 units at the NAV of that date, which
may be less than or more than Rs 20, at which he got in, If he is
getting into another fund on that day, he will be given the number of
units of that fund, calculated at the NAV of that fund, on that day. In
actual practice, the NAV used at the time of entry, called the Offer
price, and the NAV used while existing, called the Bid price. These will
be different, like the difference between the buying and selling rates
of foreign currency. This difference is called the bid-offer spread and
is normally around 0.5% .Some insurers do not have this difference for
some plans. Both offer and bid prices are the same as NAV. Some insurers
offer units at Rs. 10 per unit for a specified period from the date the
scheme begins. Insurers publish the NAVs of the various funds, which are
offered to the policyholders. This enables policyholders to track the
rate of growth of the various funds and to decide whether to continue in
the same fund or to switch to other funds. The value of the investment
on any day is the number of units held multiplied by the NAV. (NAV of
the equity fund will be = Market value of the equity shares and other
instruments available in the fund)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------Number
of units NAV needs to be tracked regularly, as it keeps changing due to
fluctuation in the value of shares. NAV determines the value of the
individual&rsquo;s investment in ULIP.</p>
<p>Value of an individual&rsquo;s investment = Number of units held X NAV
Insurance companies publish the NAV of various funds regularly in
newspapers, websites and, individual statements at regular intervals.
Policyholders can determine the growth of their investments based on
this data and take decisions regarding switching or exiting the fund.
Pricing of units There are two methods, based on which the units are
priced: Appropriation method This method is applied when funds are
expanding. The insurance company determines the price of the units based
on appropriation method, while purchasing assets (shares, bonds and
other instruments). The unit price is calculated as follows: Unit price
= (Market value of fund + Cost of purchase of assets + Current assets +
Income &ndash; Charges applicable &ndash; Current liabilities )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Number
of units in fund Expropriation method This method is applied when funds
are contracting. The insurance company determines the price of the units
based on expropriation method, while selling the assets (shares, bonds
and other instruments). The unit price is calculated as follows: Unit
price = (Market value of fund &ndash; Expenses involved in selling of
assets + Current assets + Income &ndash; Charges applicable &ndash; Current
liabilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Number
of units in fund Offer and Bid Price: Offer price: when a new
policyholder decides to invest in a fund, then the NAV on that day used
for allotting the units to him, is known as offer price.</p>
<p>Bid price: when an existing policyholder decides to redeem the units,
then the NAV on that day used for redeeming the units is known as bid
price.</p>
<p>Question 1 Which of the below fund invests in instruments with maturity
period of less than one year? Equity fund Balanced fund Debt fund Money
market fund</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-b">2. Understand the features of a ULIP
[Learning Outcome b]</h2>
<p>ULIPs offer lot of flexibility to policyholders in terms of
Flexibility to increase the insurance cover: the insurance cover or sum assured needs to be
predetermined at the time of inception of the policy. As an individual
becomes old, his liabilities may increase necessitating a higher
insurance cover. Hence some ULIPs offer an option to increase the
insurance cover during the tenure of the plan. Flexibility in change of
premium: ULIPs provide the facility of changing the premium amount
during the term of the policy to suit the premium paying capacity of the
individual. Liquidity: in a ULIP the policyholder can redeem investments
after 5 years. In case of traditional plans if the policyholder wants to
premature close his policy then he needs to surrender the policy.
Maturity amount after deduction of surrender charges is paid to the
policyholder in case of traditional plans. Top up: this is the
additional amount that can be invested by an individual over and above
the regular premium in funds of his choice. Riders: the policies can be
customised with the use of riders.</p>
<p>Choice of funds: insurance companies provide a choice of funds that the
individual can choose from. The individual can choose to invest in
equity funds, debt funds, money market funds and balanced funds to suit
his risk appetite. Switching: an individual is allowed to transfer his
existing investments from one type of fund to another fund. He can
switch his existing investments from an equity fund to debt fund /
balanced fund / money market fund and vice versa. Redirection: if a
policyholder wants to invest his fresh premium in a fund other than his
existing fund it is known as redirection. In this case the policyholder
can let his previous investments continue in the same fund and route his
fresh premium in another fund. Premium holiday: the policyholder can
stop paying the premium after 5 years and continue with the ULIP. The
charges for the subsequent years will be deducted from the existing fund
value. However the contract between the policyholder and the insurance
company gets terminated, when after deduction of charges, the fund value
becomes equal to or less than one year&rsquo;s premium.</p>
<h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>
<p>Transparency is one of the most important features of a ULIP. ULIPs
provide complete information to the policyholder regarding the break-up
of the premium paid. The policy statement clearly shows the premium
allocation charges, the mortality charges and the remaining premium that
is invested. The statement also clearly shows the break-up of policy
administration charges and the fund management charges. Insurance
companies can show their prospects projected returns (benefit
illustration) for the entire term of the plan, based on premium payment
and sum assured. Under the guidelines of IRDA, two scenarios of future
returns @ 6 % and 10 % respectively can be shown. Insurance companies
publish the NAV of funds on a regular basis, with which the policyholder
can evaluate the value of his investments and take further decisions.</p>
<h2 id="charges">Charges</h2>
<p>The various types charges levied in a ULIP are as below: The
charges recovered (i) by way of deduction from the premium and / or (ii)
by cancellation of some of the units. IRDA has issued guidelines on the
cap on charges (Ref:- 055/ IRDA/ Actl / ULIP/ 2009-10 dt 24/9/2009
(Please refer annexure section in the book for details)</p>
<p>Premium allocation charges (PAC): are deducted before allocating the
units. These charges includes the initial expenses for issuing a policy
like agent&rsquo;s commission, policy set up cost, administration cost etc.
Mortality charges: are the charges levied for covering the risk of
providing insurance cover. Fund management charges (FMC): are levied for
management of funds offered by insurance companies as investment
options. Fund management charges are deducted before determining NAV.
Policy administration charges: are levied for the administration of
ULIPs. These charges are recovered by cancellation of units on a monthly
basis. Surrender charges: are applicable if the policyholder wants to
close the policy before its normal tenure. Surrender means premature
withdrawal of funds &ndash; partial or full. The charge is expressed as a
percentage of fund value or annual premium. Switching charges: are
applicable when the policyholder wants to transfer (switch) his existing
investments from one fund to another fund. Insurers allow few switches
on a quarterly / yearly basis free of cost. Switches over and above the
free switches are chargeable. Statutory levies: Service Tax and
Education Cess are applicable as per Government rules from time to time.
These levies are deducted before allocation of units is done from the
premium. Riders: Similar to traditional plans, riders are also available
with ULIPs. Additional premiums need to be paid by the policyholder for
the rider. Some of the riders that are offered with ULIPs are as
follows: Accidental Death Benefit (ADB) Rider Disability Benefit Rider
Critical Illness Rider Hospital Cash Benefit Rider Waiver of Premium
Rider Revival of ULIP policies: If a policyholder does not pay premium
on the due date, the policyholder gets some days of grace during which
the policyholder can pay the premium. This is known as grace period. The
grace period for all types of linked products where the premium payment
mode is monthly, the grace period is 15 days in all other modes, the
grace period is 30 days.</p>
<p>If the policyholder doesn&rsquo;t pay the premium within the grace period then
the policy lapses. Where the policies lapse, the policyholder is
entitled to one of the following options: to revive the policy to
continue the policy only to the extent of risk cover and to continue
with the policy with the risk cover and as part of the fund. to withdraw
completely from the fund without any risk cover. For detailed

of the above</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-c">Compare ULIPs with traditional insurance products.
[Learning Outcome c]</h2>
<p>The underwriting process for ULIPs and traditional insurance plans
is similar. The company calculates the premium based on the sum assured
and the information provided by the individual regarding his medical
condition, age and other material facts. Earlier traditional plans, had
a predefined relationship of premium and sum assured, whereas ULIPs
allow the policyholder to choose the sum assured within a certain limit,
for a specific premium. Apart from this, there are several other
differences among ULIPs and traditional plans.</p>
<p>Difference based on</p>
<p>Traditional Plans</p>
<p>ULIPs</p>
<p>Premiums</p>
<p>The premiums are combined in a common fund known as life fund and are
invested by the insurer</p>
<p>Part of the premium is deduction for PAC and mortality and rest is
invested in the fund chosen by the policyholder.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p>Could be either guaranteed or nonguaranteed and are predetermined.</p>
<p>Benefits depend on the performance of investment fund chosen by the
policyholder. The benefits have to be within the scope of regulations
issued by IRDA.</p>
<p>Withdrawal</p>
<p>The plan could be surrendered, but the policyholder has to bear the loss
in the form of higher surrender charges.</p>
<p>The investments can be withdrawn after 5 years and the returns will
depend upon the NAV at the point of time.</p>
<p>Bonus</p>
<p>Bonus is payable for participating policies (&ldquo;with profit&rdquo; policies)</p>
<p>Bonus is not payable. However some insurers pay persistency (loyalty)
units for long term policies</p>
<p>Loans</p>
<p>Loans can be taken against the surrender value of the policy. Loan
amount given is normally 75-90% of surrender value.</p>
<p>Loan amount are now allowed to be given for products on sale after
01/09/2010 subject to regulations /conditions which are issued by IRDA.</p>
<p>The breakup of charges Transparency is not known to the policyholders
but only to the insurer.</p>
<p>ULIPs are high on transparency and regulators insists premium break up
in terms of PAC, mortality, FMC, administration charges etc. and caps on
each of these charges.</p>
<p>Loss</p>
<p>Loss is unlikely as the benefits are normally predetermined</p>
<p>There may be a loss if the NAV of the fund chosen by the client drops
drastically as equity prices are very volatile.</p>
<p>Profits</p>
<p>Profits are received through bonus, under participating policy (&ldquo;with
profits&rdquo;) policy by the insurers.</p>
<p>The profits depend on the performance of constituents of the fund chosen
by the policy holder.</p>
<h2 id="irda-guidelines">IRDA Guidelines</h2>
<p>Recently IRDA has issued a lot of new guidelines for
ULIPs which has resulted in a major overhaul of ULIPs. All insurance
companies were asked to comply with these guidelines from September
2010. Following are some of those guidelines: The three year lock-in
period for all Unit Linked Products will be increased to a period of
five years, including top-up premiums. During this period, no residuary
payments on policies which are lapsed / surrendered / discontinued will
be made. The residuary payments for policies arising out of policies
which stand lapsed/surrendered/discontinued during the lock-in period
shall be payable on the expiry of the lock in period and in accordance
with the relevant Regulations of IRDA. All regular premium / limited
premium ULIPs shall have uniform / level paying premiums. Any additional
payments shall be treated as single premium for the purpose of insurance
cover.</p>
<p>All limited premium unit linked insurance products, other than single
premium products, shall have premium paying term of at least 5 years.
The insurers shall distribute the overall charges, in ULIPs in an even
fashion during the lock-in period. All unit linked products, other than
pension and annuity products shall provide a minimum mortality cover or
a health cover, as indicated below: (i) Minimum mortality cover should
be as follows: Minimum Sum assured for age at entry of below 45 years</p>
<p>Minimum Sum assured for age at entry of 45 years and above</p>
<p>Single Premium (SP) contracts: 125 percent of single premium. Regular
Premium (RP) including limited premium paying (LPP) contracts: 10 times
the annualized premiums or (0.5 X T X annualized premium) whichever is
higher. At no time the death benefit shall be less than 105 percent of
the total premiums (including top-ups) paid.</p>
<p>Single Premium (SP) contracts: 110 percent of single premium Regular
Premium (RP) including limited premium paying (LPP) contracts: 7 times
the annualized premiums or (0.25 X T X annualized premium) whichever is
higher. At no time the death benefit shall be less than 105 percent of
the total premiums (including top-ups) paid.</p>
<p>(In case of whole life contracts, term (T) shall be taken as 70 minus
age at entry) (ii) The minimum health cover per annum should be as
follows: Minimum annual health cover for age at entry of below 45 years
Regular Premium (RP) contracts: 5 times the annualized premiums or Rs.
100,000 per annum whichever is higher, At no time the annual health
cover shall be less than 105 percent of the total premiums paid.</p>
<p>Minimum annual health cover for age at entry of 45 years and above
Regular Premium (RP) contracts: 5 times the annualized premiums or Rs.
75,000 per annum whichever is higher. At no time the annual health cover
shall be less than 105 percent of the total premiums paid</p>
<p>All top-up premiums made during the currency of the contract, except for
pension/annuity products, must have insurance cover treating them as
single premium, as per above table. The accumulated fund value of unit
linked pension / annuity products is the fund value as on the maturity
date. All ULIP pension / annuity products shall offer a minimum
guaranteed return of 4.5 per cent per annum or as specified by IRDA from
time to time, on the maturity date. This guaranteed return is applicable
on the maturity date, for policies where all due premiums are paid.
Mortality and / or health cover could be offered along with the
pension/annuity products as riders, giving enough flexibility for the
policyholders to select covers of their choice. In the case of unit
linked pension / annuity products, no partial withdrawal shall be
allowed during the accumulation phase and the insurer shall convert the
accumulated fund value into an annuity at the vesting date. However, the
insured will have an option to commute up to a maximum of one-third of
the accumulated value as lump sum at the time of vesting. In the case of
surrender, only a maximum of one-third of the surrender value can be
commuted after the lock-in period. The remaining amount must be used to
purchase an annuity, subject to the provisions of Section 4 of Insurance
Act, 1938. rd</p>
<p>Vide circular 3 cited above, caps on charges were fixed on Unit Linked
contracts with a tenor of 10 years or less and for those with tenor
above 10 years. However, taking into account the discontinuance /
lapsation / surrender behaviour and with a view to smoothen the cap on
charges, the following limits are prescribed starting from the 5th
policy anniversary: Annualized Maximum reduction in yield (Difference
Premiums Paid between Gross and Net Yield (% pa)) 4.00% 5 3.75% 6 3.50%
7 3.30% 8 3.15% 9 3.00% 10 2.75 % 11 and 12 2.50 % 13 and 14 2.25 % 15
and thereafter</p>
<p>The net reduction in yield for policies with term less than or equal to
10 years shall not be more than 3.00% at maturity. For policies with
term above 10 years, the net reduction in yield at maturity shall not be
more than 2.25%. The maximum loan amount that can be sanctioned under
any ULIP policy shall not exceed 40% of the net asset value in those
products where equity accounts for more than 60% of the total share and
shall not exceed 50% of the net asset value of those products where debt
instruments accounts for more than 60% of the total share.</p>
<p>Question 3 As per IRDA guidelines, the lock in period for ULIP is
__________ years. 2 3 5 10</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Unit linked insurance plans (ULIPs) are market linked insurance
plans. ULIPs combine the features of investment and protection. Amount
that is invested in funds is termed as units and their values are
expressed as Net Asset value (NAV) Net Asset value of a fund means net
value of a fund on a particular date When a new policyholder decides to
invest in a fund, the NAV on that day which is used for allotting the
units to him is known as offer price. When an existing policyholder
decides to redeem the units from ULIP, then the NAV that is used to
redeem the units is known as bid price. The difference in NAV at the
time of entry(offer price) and exit (bid price) is known as bid-offer
spread Top-up is the additional amount that can be paid by the
individual to increase his investment contribution. ULIPs have a lock-in
period of 5 years.</p>
