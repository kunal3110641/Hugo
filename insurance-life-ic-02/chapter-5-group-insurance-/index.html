<h2 id="group-insurance">GROUP INSURANCE</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>In this competitive age, insurance
companies are trying their level best to secure the highest client base.
For this they try to come up with various innovative products to attract
maximum customers towards them. They are also trying to expand their
operations involving different customer segments. Corporate clients are
one such customer segment that is being targeted by insurance companies.
Corporate clients in turn, are trying to outsource their various
activities to specialists in the fields (e.g. Actuaries) such as
managing the funds for gratuity, pension, leave encashment etc. who have
the required expertise and experience for managing these. In this
chapter we will study about how insurance companies try to provide
solutions to corporate clients for managing these employee benefits
though group insurance.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Understand the importance of group insurance. Learn about the different
group insurance schemes.</p>
<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this scenario</h2>
<p>Makheja Group is a leading textile manufacturer of
the country. They have over 200 employees. Makheja Group&rsquo;s main concern
is to retain the best of talent in their company. They spend huge
amounts of money in providing various benefits to their employees. This
is done to discourage the employees from leaving the company and also
seek corporate tax exemptions. Some of the benefits that are provided by
Makheja Group are life insurance, superannuation, and gratuity, leave
encashment, pension etc. Gratuity and superannuation are long term
liabilities, the provision for which has to be made today. Also gratuity
that is provided to employees is a statutory requirement; hence the
company has to make sure that the legal aspects are well taken care of
The biggest problem the Makheja Group faces is to determine the correct
amount of liability (payments to be made towards gratuity, pension etc)
that will arise in future. Also they need to efficiently invest these
funds to get optimum returns. The solution that the Makheja Group is
looking for is to have these liabilities managed by personnel with the
necessary expertise in managing the corporate benefits provided to their
employees. It will help Makheja Group a great deal maximizing the
benefits to their employees. This is where insurance companies can pitch
in with their expertise (e.g. by actuaries) and help companies like the
Makheja Group and others. In this chapter we will learn about the
various retirement benefits schemes offered by employers to their
employees and how insurance companies help companies manage these
schemes.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-a">1. Understand the importance of group insurance.
[Learning Outcome a]</h2>
<p>Group insurance The solution to the plan discussed above is provided by
insurance companies in the form of Group Insurance. Life insurance
companies cater to corporate clients by providing services to manage
various benefits such as term insurance, pension, gratuity etc.
Insurance companies provide several group insurance schemes to their
corporate clients to cater to their various requirements.</p>
<p>Group insurance schemes provide insurance to a group of people under one
single master policy. The individuals who get insurance cover under the
policy are referred to as &lsquo;members&rsquo; of the group insurance scheme.
Individuals, who exit the organisation to join any other organisation,
may or may not continue, to derive benefits of group insurance scheme,
depending on the terms and condition of the scheme. The amount of
insurance cover for each employee depends upon certain criteria such as:
Employee grade / designation Salary drawn by the individuals Duration of
employment with the current employer etc Group insurance can be
terminated by the insurance company or the employer at the end of any
year. Apart from the group insurance provided by the employer, personal
insurance can also be taken by employees on their own. As many person
are covered under one single contract, the administrative cost are low,
because the coverage is not at the choice of the individual concerned,
the chance of an adverse selection is low. The terms and the coverage
can be re-negotiated at the time of renewal. Eligibility for group
insurance Employer - Employee groups: The most important target group
for group insurance scheme is the employer - employee group. Employer is
a word used for either a large company or a small firm. The only
condition is that there should be a minimum number of employees (say
generally 15 &ndash; 20) working in that company. The employees of an
organisation are treated as one group, to whom insurance is issued as a
single unit. The employees get the benefit of group insurance till they
are employed by the company. The individual beneficiary members of the
group cannot choose the amount of insurance cover. The amount will be
determined on criteria which are applied uniformly to all the members of
the group.</p>
<p>The Makheja group, discussed in the concept given above is an example of
this kind of a group. Makheja group as an employer can take group
insurance for its employees. All 200 employees will be considered as a
single unit for providing group insurance.</p>
<p>Professional associations: These groups are formed to protect the
interest of professionals like doctors, engineers, lawyers, chartered
accountants etc. These professional associations can avail the benefits
of group insurance. Co-operative Societies: are organisations which are
managed by individuals for their mutual benefit. Creditor &ndash; debtor:
Under this group, the creditor, who has provided some loan to
individuals, can take group insurance for covering the dues of debtors
to safeguard his loans which have been advanced. Examples can be banks,
NBFCs seeking insurance cover for loans given by them to their
customers. Weaker sections of the society: group insurance also targets
the weaker sections of the society, who otherwise, would not have been
able to take the advantage of insurance. It should be remembered that if
a group is formed specifically with the intent to get the benefit of
insurance, it will not be eligible for group insurance.</p>
<h2 id="main-features-of-group-insurance-are-as-follows">Main features of group insurance are as follows:</h2>
<p>Master policy: As a group is considered
as a single unit, a single policy known as a master policy is issued to
the authorised person of the group who pays the premium. The individual
are the beneficiaries. They are not parties to the contract. The amount
and terms of insurance are negotiated by the policyholder and not by the
individual beneficiaries. The benefits will be determined on basis that
apply uniformly to all the individuals. In an employer &ndash; employee
group, the employer is issued a &ldquo;master policy&rdquo; by the insurance company
and the individual employees are covered. In a creditor debtor group,
the creditor will be issued the master policy. For example a bank will
be issued a master policy for its borrowers(debtors) who have availed of
housing or vehicle loans etc Certificate of insurance: The employees who
get covered under group insurance are issued certificates of insurance
(COI). Individual members are not separately evaluated on risk factors.
Underwriting is based on an assessment of the group as a whole. Minimum
requirements like &ldquo;actively at work&rdquo; and &ldquo;no medical leave for the last
6 months&rdquo; could be the simple conditions of eligibility (The definition
of &ldquo;actively at work&rdquo; could differ from one group to the other.</p>
<p>Everybody fulfilling specified criteria will have to compulsorily join
the group. Usually, when the scheme is being introduced for the first
time, the existing members will be given a choice of joining or not
joining the scheme. The choice, to be made within a specified period,
will be final. In other words, if a member opts not to join, he cannot
change his mind later. These are methods to avoid adverse selection.
Exits will be as per the conditions of the contract like on retirement
or death or termination of membership from the group. Free cover limit:
In order to reduce administrative expenses, insurance companies try to
simplify the whole process of managing a group insurance based on the
precriteria mentioned above. For this, they stipulate a certain maximum
amount, up to which medical check-up of employees will not be required.
This amount is known as free cover limit or no evidence limit ( as no
medical evidence is generally called for)</p>
<p>The insurance company for the employees of Makheja group provides a free
cover limit of Rs 1,00,000. Hence employees will not be required to
undergo medical check-up for insurance of upto Rs. 1,00,000, if they
fulfil the criteria of &quot; actively at work &quot; and &quot; no medical leave for
the last 6 months.(these definitions could can vary from one group to
the other). The idea behind free cover limit is that the insurance
company assumes that if the employee is working in an organisation, the
employee is medically fit and able to work for the specified hours. Also
employees generally have to undergo a medical check-up and provide
medical fitness certificates before they join any organisation. Based on
this notion the insurance companies grant group insurance upto free
cover limit without a medical test. The amounts of free cover offered to
the different groups can vary between groups and sub-groups.</p>

<p>Premiums The premium payment in a group insurance policy is annual and
is paid by the employer. However in some schemes, the employee and
employer together can make the contribution. Based on as to who pays the
premium, group insurance plans can be categorised into two types:
Contributory insurance plan: in this plan the members also pay a part of
the premium. In employer-employee group the employer deducts a certain
amount of premium from the salaries of the employees. In a contributory
insurance plan only the employees who wish to participate in the group
insurance agree to allow deduction from salary and rest do not allow a
deduction from salary and hence are not covered under the group
insurance plan. Non-contributory insurance plan: in this plan the
members do not contribute the premium. In a non-contributory employer &ndash;
employee group, the employer pays the entire amount of premium. All the
employees of the company get insurance cover under this plan.</p>
<h2 id="eligibility-conditions-in-group-insurance">Eligibility conditions in group insurance:</h2>
<p>The general eligibility
conditions in group insurance are as follows: Formation of the group:
Insurance cover must not be the prime motive for the formation or
existence of the group. Minimum number: there should be a minimum number
of members in a group generally 15 &ndash; 20 or more persons may be adequate
for group insurance and there may be no maximum limit. Active at work:
the employee should be active at work, on the date of insurance
commencement i.e., employee should not be absent from duty due to
sickness or any other reason for the last 6 months. The insurance cover
will not be provided to such an employee till he joins duty. Probation:
probationary period can range between 6 months to 1 year and depends
upon the policy of the company. Some companies provide group insurance
only to confirmed employees after completion of probation. Some
companies provide group insurance only to full time employees. Some
companies provide group insurance only to employees above a certain
grade. Age limit: some companies have age limits for group insurance. It
may be specified that an employee&rsquo;s age should be less than 60 years for
group insurance and he / she should have joined the organisation, before
the age of 55. New employees: in a non-contributory scheme, all new
employees who join the organisation become eligible for group insurance.
In a contributory plan, there may be a waiting period (usually a month)
for the employee, after which he can join the group insurance scheme.
Cover limit: the beneficiary will not be able to choose the amount of
insurance cover. It will be determined on a criterion which can be
applied uniformly to all members of the group. This takes care of the
risk of anti-selection. Administration: there has to be a single
administrative organisation to be willing and able to act on behalf of
the group. Normally this is the administrative officer of the employer
or association.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-group-insurance">Benefits of group insurance:</h2>
<p>Group insurance can be taken by an
individual, who cannot afford to purchase individual plan due to a high
premium. Administrative costs for the insurer are low, as a single
policy needs to be issued and managed. Group insurance plan needs to be
renewed each year. The employer or the insurance company can choose not
to renew the contract if either of the two parties is not satisfied with
the other. Free cover limit: no medical checkup is required up to a
certain amount due to following reasons: As the employees are &ldquo;actively
at work&rdquo;, the employees are considered healthy enough to work full time
for the company. The company, before selecting an employee, generally
insists on a medical checkup, which ensures the good health evaluation
of the employee. Employees do not join an organisation for availing
insurance cover and so the element of adverse selection is reduced.
Note: Even if the individual is suffering from a certain medical
condition that would not enable him to get an insurance policy
individually, he is generally able to receive insurance under group
insurance. It is therefore advantageous to the member of the group.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Group_insurance_52.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="group-term-insurance-scheme">Group Term Insurance Scheme</h2>
<p>Group term insurance scheme provides life
insurance cover to a group of people as a single entity. Like individual
term policy, the group term insurance scheme, provides death cover to
the members. In the case of the death of a member the nominee is paid
the sum assured under the scheme. In an employer &ndash; employee group, the
employer will act as the principal policyholder and the employees are
the members who will be insured under the scheme. Majority of the
employees of an organisation are covered under the scheme. Any new
employee, who joins thereafter, automatically becomes eligible for group
insurance scheme depending on the terms and conditions of the
organisation. Features of group term insurance scheme Master policy: A
single master policy is issued to the employer. Certificate Of Insurance
(COI): is issued to each member as a proof of the insurance cover
provided to them. Sum assured: could be determined in different ways It
could be the multiple of the annual salary of the employee It could
depend on the designation or grade of the employee It could depend on
the tenure of the employee in the organisation.</p>
<p>If an employer chooses to provide the sum assured based on
organisational hierarchy, then the sum assured will be derived on the
basis of designation / grade of the employee and his salary. Hence
higher the grade, higher will be the sum assured available as insurance
cover.</p>
<p>Premium: the premium is paid by the employer annually as a lump sum
payment thereby keeping the administration costs low. The term of the
scheme is only for one year. After the completion of each year the
contract has to be renewed by the employer and insurance company.
Premium charges may be revised annually at the time of renewal of the
scheme. Premium payment for the group is considered as business expense
of the employer in the books of accounts.</p>
<p>Premium pricing in group insurance is based on: Size of the group Age
distribution of the group. Number of employees that have retired or have
left the company. Number of new employees who have joined the company.
Diagram 3: Premium pricing in group insurance</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Group_insurance_53.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>In the case of a contributory scheme a certain percentage of the premium
is paid by the employee and rest of the amount is paid by the employer.
The amount of premium could be deducted from the employee&rsquo;s salary. In a
non-contributory scheme, the entire premium will be paid by the
employer.</p>
<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility:</h2>
<p>Groups: group term insurance is generally provided to
employer &ndash; employee relationships. It could also be provided to
professional association of doctors, lawyers etc. Members of banks,
trade unions and weaker sections of the society are also eligible for
group term insurance. Age: with regard to age, there may be a condition.
For example, the age of the employee, to be eligible for group term
insurance scheme should generally be between 18 to 60 years.
Administration cost: the administrative cost for group insurance policy
is low as compared to individual policies. Claim: when a claim arises,
the details of the member along with a death certificate are required to
be submitted. Claim settlement in group insurance is comparatively easy
as compared to individual insurance. Free cover limit: no medical
check-up is required due to free cover limit. The disadvantage is that
the members who have adverse medical conditions will get the advantage
of insurance, who otherwise would not have been eligible for individual
insurance. Tax benefits: the amount paid as premium is treated as
business expense, hence deductible under tax laws. Even death claims
provided to nominees are tax free.</p>
<h2 id="group-gratuity-scheme">Group Gratuity Scheme:</h2>
<p>According to the Payment of Gratuity Act 1972, any company having more than 10
employees, has to provide gratuity to its employees. Gratuity needs to
be paid in the case of: the death of the employee disability of the
employee on the resignation of the employee (subject to certain
conditions) on the retirement of the employee</p>
<h2 id="diagram-4-payment-of-gratuity">Diagram 4: Payment of gratuity</h2>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Group_insurance_54.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Hence gratuity is a statutory requirement for which each employer has to
make necessary arrangements. Liability for gratuity payment arises on a
future date, but the funds need to be managed prior to the payment of
gratuity. Companies can purchase Group Gratuity Scheme from insurance
companies and can add provisions that enhance the value of the benefit
available to their employees.</p>
<h2 id="methods-of-gratuity-payment">Methods of gratuity payment</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Pay- as &ndash;you- go&rsquo; method: gratuity could be paid by the company, when it falls
due i.e. at the time of retirement, or the employee&rsquo;s exit. Under this
method the payment is made from the current revenues of the company.
&ldquo;Pay- as- you-go&rdquo; method is not a prudent practice that should be
followed by an employer as the gratuity payment depends largely on the
amount of salary and number of years of service of an employee. An
estimate of the future liabilities should be made and certain funds out
of the revenues should be arranged for meeting these liabilities. In
case a large number of employees decide to leave the company at the same
time, it would be very difficult for the company to pay such a large
amount under the &ldquo;pay- as &ndash; you - go &ndash; method&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="create-an-internal-reserve">Create an internal reserve:</h2>
<p>the company makes an estimate of the future
liability of gratuity payments and reserves some amount for meeting
these liabilities in future. The disadvantage of this method is that it
just a mere accounting entry in the books of accounts and the company
might use these funds for meeting its current requirements or some other
contingency. To prevent the diversion of funds for any other purpose
apart from the payment of gratuity, the management of the company will
have to be very strict and disciplined. Setting up a Gratuity Fund: the
company may set up a Gratuity Fund as an irrevocable trust. The trustees
will manage the investments of the fund comprising the contributions,
and make payments of gratuity from the fund. The trustees may or may not
have the necessary expertise for investing the funds in the right
avenues to earn high returns on the funds invested. Group Gratuity
Scheme: in this method, a trust needs to be created by the company for
gratuity payments to employees. The trust may enter into a Group
Gratuity Scheme contract with an insurer. The funds reserved for the
gratuity payments are handed over to the insurer for managing the
gratuity portfolio. The insurer with its massive investment portfolio is
in a better position to secure maximum benefits from the market, in
terms of protection from fluctuations as well as better spread, than an
individual trust with its relatively small portfolio can do. The benefit
of group term insurance, given by an insurer helps the families of
employees dying early get gratuity as if the employee had completed the
full term of service.</p>
<p>If Makheja group takes the group gratuity scheme from an insurance
company, it will have following advantages: The funds for gratuity will
be managed by the insurance company, which will have the necessary
expertise and trained staff for managing the funds and secure good
return on investments in various market securities and at the same time
ensure the safety of the investment portfolio. The insurance company can
use its actuarial skills to estimate future liabilities of the company.
Actuaries have necessary expertise in the field, hence future liability
estimates are bound to be more accurate.</p>
<p>The insurance company can also provide the benefit of group term
insurance to employees in addition to gratuity. In case an employee dies
during employment, the nominee / beneficiary will get gratuity payment
as if the employee had completed the full term of service. This is an
additional benefit provided by the insurance company to the employee.
This will be extremely helpful to the dependents of the employee in case
of his early death during employment, as the nominee will get payment
for the full service.</p>
<p>Eligibility: only those employees who are on direct payroll of the
company come under the purview of Gratuity Act. The employee needs to
complete 5 years of continuous service in the organisation, to be
eligible for payment of gratuity. Gratuity calculation: gratuity is
calculated based on the number of years of service completed by the
employee and the last salary drawn. The employer has to pay 15 days
salary for each completed year of service. Gratuity upto a certain limit
are tax free. Gratuity is calculated as follows Gratuity = ((Basic + DA)
X 15 days X number of years of service) 26 If there is an increase in
years of service or the salary of the employee, the gratuity payment
will also increase, thereby increasing the liability of the company. The
company gets benefit in many ways, if they tie up with an insurance
company for administration of these changes: The insurance company
manages the funding for gratuity on cash accumulation basis. The
contributions that are made by the company and the interest payment by
the insurance company, both are irreversible. This fund will be
available for settlement of claims as and when required. The
contribution of the company towards gratuity fund is shown as business
expense in the books of accounts. Hence the company gets tax benefit on
the same. If at a time large number of employees leave the company, then
the financial burden in terms of gratuity payment will not be much as
the company would have already discharged its liabilities in the form of
premium payment to the insurance company.</p>
<h2 id="group-superannuation-scheme">Group Superannuation Scheme</h2>
<p>Group Superannuation Scheme is a pension
scheme, in which insurance companies provide superannuation at group
level. Regular contribution is made by the employer towards the pension
fund. After retirement this corpus can be used by the employee to take
an annuity from the insurer. This will provide him with a regular stream
of income after retirement. The employer can purchase a group
superannuation scheme from an insurance company and entrust the
management of pension fund to the insurance company.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-group-superannuation-schemes">Types of group superannuation schemes</h2>
<p>Group superannuation scheme can be of two types:
Defined contribution scheme: in this scheme, a certain amount is
contributed regularly towards the pension fund. This amount from the
pension fund is invested and managed by the insurance company. At
retirement, the pension will depend upon the accumulated amount of the
fund (amount invested and the return on amount invested). Hence in this
case the amount of the pension that employee will receive after
retirement cannot be predetermined in advance. Disadvantage of the
defined contribution scheme is that an employer has to make sure that
the funds are invested prudentially; otherwise there can be a loss on
investment. Defined benefit scheme: in this scheme the pension that an
employee will receive after retirement is predetermined. Certain amount
of money is periodically deposited in a pension fund, which is invested
and managed by the insurance company. But irrespective of the return
received and the entire corpus of the fund, the pension that will be
given to the employee will depend upon the last salary drawn by the
employee. As the pension amount is known in advance and depends upon the
salary and not on investments, hence this scheme is known as defined
benefit scheme. Advantages of defined benefit scheme: The amount of
pension fund could become quite substantial if the investments earn good
return and there can be a surplus. The employer does not have to worry
about the amount to be paid, as this is predetermined and can be planned
accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-the-defined-benefit-scheme">Disadvantages of the defined benefit scheme:</h2>
<p>If the investment gives
lower return than expected then there can be a deficit and the burden of
that will have to be borne by the employer.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-pension">Types of pension:</h2>
<p>The pension options that are provided to employees by insurance company are
as follows: Pension for life: in this case pension is paid throughout
the employee&rsquo;s life till his / her death. Pension for life with return
of premiums: in this case the pension is paid throughout the life of the
employee. The premiums paid are returned to the nominee after employee&rsquo;s
death. Pension for specified time period: in this case the employee gets
a guaranteed pension for a specified term like 5, 10, 15 or 20 years and
throughout his life thereafter. In case the employee dies within the
specified time period then the nominee will be paid the pension for the
remaining term. Pension for joint life: in this case the pension is paid
to the employee. On his death, the pension is paid to the spouse</p>
<p>Diagram 5: Types of pension</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/group_insurance_55.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Eligibility: provision for pension is not a statutory requirement. Hence
the management has a choice of including all the employees for
superannuation scheme or to choose only the employees in selected
hierarchies. Again here also the comments given under Eligibility of
Group Gratuity scheme applicable.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-group-superannuation">Benefits of Group Superannuation</h2>
<p>Scheme On retirement: of an employee, the corpus (contribution +
interest) is used to provide pension to the employee. On death: in case
there is a group insurance scheme along with the group superannuation
scheme then on the death of the employee during service, a lump sum
payment is made to the beneficiary. Expert help: insurance companies are
responsible for ascertaining future liabilities of the employer, and to
ensure that pensions are paid timely for a long period of time. They
have the necessary expertise in management of funds as well. Hence the
insurance company provides actuarial, legal, taxation and management
expertise to the employer.</p>
<p>Change in the employer: an employee can choose to transfer funds to the
superannuation scheme of the new employer or opt for immediate or
deferred pension. Contribution: the contribution is made by the
employer. But in some contributory schemes, both the employee and
employer can contribute. Tax benefit: the amount contributed towards
superannuation scheme is a business expense and hence the employer can
claim deduction from taxable income for the same. Note: There are
considerable tax advantages both to the employer and the employee in
both, Group Gratuity &amp; Group Pension arrangements. The tax advantages
are conditional on these schemes being approved by the Income Tax
Authorities. Group Leave Encashment Scheme As per the Companies Act
1956, companies have to provide leave encashment facility to the
employees. Leave encashment is a lump sum amount that is payable to the
employee at the time of his retirement / leaving the company for the
leaves that he / she has accumulated during the tenure of service in the
company. The leave encashment amount depends on the number of unused
days of leave and the salary of the employee at the time of retirement /
leaving the company. The company can get into a group leave encashment
scheme arrangement with the insurer. The scheme enables funding of leave
encashment. The insurance company can also provide a group term
insurance cover along with this scheme which will result in a sum
assured payable to the nominee in the case of the death of the employee
during service. A small premium amount is collected along with the
contribution for leave encashment fund. On the death of the employee,
the nominee gets the amount of insurance cover along with the leave
encashment amount. The liability of the employer under leave encashment
increases with time as leave encashment is directly related to the
designation and the salary of the employee. The group leave encashment
scheme provides help to the employer in meeting this liability. A group
term insurance cover may also be provided along with group leave
encashment scheme to the employees. Group leave encashment scheme allows
the employee to encash unused days of leave. For group leave encashment
scheme, a running account is maintained by the insurance company, where
all the contributions made by the employer are credited.</p>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits:</h2>
<p>Leave encashment amount is paid to employee from the funds
maintained for meeting this liability, when he leaves / retires from the
company or when he decides to encash the days of leave. In the case of
the employee&rsquo;s death, the beneficiary will be paid a lumpsum insurance
cover. The premium paid towards leave encashment scheme is treated as a
business expense and hence the employer can claim deduction from taxable
income for the same.</p>
<h2 id="employees-deposit-linked-insurance-edli-scheme">Employees&rsquo; Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) Scheme</h2>
<p>If a company is covered under the Employee Provident Fund Scheme under
the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952,
there is a statutory requirement that, the company has to contribute
towards Employees&rsquo; Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) Scheme. A
contribution of 0.51% of each employee&rsquo;s monthly salary is made by the
employer for EDLI. In EDLI the insurance cover will be dependent on the
balance in provident fund account. EDLI has the provision of making
payment to nominees in the case of employee&rsquo;s death. The amount payable
will be equal to the average balance amount in the employee provident
fund during the past 12 months till his death. If the average balance
exceeds Rs. 35,000 then the insurance cover will be calculated as below:
Rs 35,000 + 25% (balance above Rs 35,000) The insurance cover cannot
exceed Rs. 60,000. Hence, if the duration of service and the salary of
the employee are not significant, the insurance cover will be very
limited; the benefit to the nominee will be inadequate. Hence group
insurance scheme in lieu of EDLI is an alternative plan offered by an
insurance company.</p>
<h2 id="group-insurance-scheme-in-lieu-of-edli">Group Insurance Scheme in lieu of EDLI</h2>
<p>Eligibility: The employer has to claim exemption from the EDLI scheme from the
Central Provident Fund Commissioner to provide insurance benefit though
the alterative scheme &ldquo;Group Insurance Scheme in lieu of EDLI&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Benefits: Employees get high insurance cover as compared to EDLI Lower
administration cost on part of the employer Easy settlement of claim as
insurance company requires only the death certificate Premium paid is
treated as business expense and hence the employer gets tax benefit on
it. Social Security Scheme Social security is a concern in all countries
throughout the world, although the dimensions may vary considerably. In
some countries, the expenses of the elderly persons are borne by the
State as a social measure. In some countries, medical care is free. Most
of the funds are generated through levies and taxation. In India, group
term insurance is a made available to poorer sections of society. In
case of death, say a sum of Rs 5000/- is paid to the dependents of the
deceased. The amount paid is double (Rs 10,000/-) is paid to the
dependents, if the death is due to an accident. According to the
directives of the Central Government a Social Security Fund was created
in the fiscal year 1998-99. This fund was conceived by LIC, with an aim,
to provide insurance cover to the economically weaker sections of the
society. LIC maintains it with half the amount drawn from the social
security fund while the rest of the amount is collected from designated
nodal agencies. Nodal agency refers to a State Government department
which is concerned with the welfare of a vocation group, a welfare fund
or society, village panchayat, NGO, self-help group etc. The Indian
Government has approved various occupations for the social security
scheme. Some of the occupations which come under the purview of social
security scheme are: Rickshaw pullers Handloom workers Artisans Tailors
Barbers Masons Co-operative milk producers Landless agricultural workers
etc. Social Security Scheme offers life protection to weaker sections of
the society.</p>

beforehand it is known as ___________ Guaranteed benefit
pension scheme Group superannuation scheme Defined contribution scheme
Defined benefit scheme.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Group insurance provides insurance cover to a group of people
under one single master policy. The individuals who get insurance cover
under the policy are referred as &lsquo;members&rsquo; of the group insurance
scheme. The employees who get covered under group insurance are issued
certificate of insurance. Medical checkup of employees is not necessary
if the insurance cover is up to free cover limit. If the employer
deducts an amount of premium from the salaries of employees, it is known
as contributory insurance plan. In a non-contributory plan the employer
pays the entire amount of premium. Insurance companies offer Group
Gratuity Schemes, Group Superannuation Schemes and Group Leave
Encashment Schemes to employers.</p>
