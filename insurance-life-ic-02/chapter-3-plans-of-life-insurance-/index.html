<meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER 3 PLANS OF LIFE INSURANCE Chapter Introduction In recent times, there have been drastic changes in the social structure we live in. There has been an increase in nuclear families, leaving the senior citizens alone, to manage on their own. Senior citizens today do not want to be dependent on their children for meeting their post retirement expenses. They want to be financially independent. With changed life styles, every parent aspires to provide the best of education to their children, without compromising on their life styles." />

<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>In recent times, there have
been drastic changes in the social structure we live in. There has been
an increase in nuclear families, leaving the senior citizens alone, to
manage on their own. Senior citizens today do not want to be dependent
on their children for meeting their post retirement expenses. They want
to be financially independent. With changed life styles, every parent
aspires to provide the best of education to their children, without
compromising on their life styles. Today while investing in insurance,
individuals not only want security against unforeseen circumstances, but
also good returns on their hard earned money so that they can make
provisions for their children&rsquo;s education and marriage expenses, their
own retirement etc. Hence insurance companies are launching new
insurance plans, with various features to fulfil the requirements of
today&rsquo;s generation. In this chapter we will discuss about the various
insurance plans that are available in the market and analyse their
various benefits.</p>

<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this scenario</h2>
<p>Rahul is a software Engineer, working in a leading
MNC. He has been working with the company for the past 5 years. He is a
happily married man who has a two year old child, Jagat. Over the years
he has invested his savings in banks and some mutual funds. He has been
apprehensive of insurance policies as his belief is that they do not
provide good returns on the money invested. He looks at insurance
policies as an expense, where he would have to pay premiums for a long
period, without any returns. One day, his boss Mohan Kumar suffers a
severe heart attack and dies on the way to the hospital. He is survived
by his wife and a 10 year old child.. He is quite disturbed on hearing
that the family has to move into a smaller apartment as they were facing
a financial crisis after Mohan Kumar&rsquo;s death. Apparently Mohan Kumar had
left a large debt in the form of personal, home and car loans. Their
savings were limited and consequently, the child had been taken out of
the exclusive school that he was studying in, as they could not now
afford the fees. Rahul was quite disturbed after visiting Mohan Kumar&rsquo;s
family. Rahul wanted to make sure that his family does not have to not
go through the same situation if something had to happen to him. He
decides to take an insurance to safeguard his family&rsquo;s future. He
decides to buy an insurance plan that can help him meet all his
financial commitments such as his son&rsquo;s education, medical expenses and
so on, easily. The question is can the insurance companies offer such
plans to Rahul, through which he would be able to save for his above
mentioned financial needs? We will learn about it in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-a">1. Analyse various life insurance plans.
[Learning Outcome a]</h2>
<p>There are several life insurance plans that are being provided by insurance
companies to fulfil various needs of an individual such as: meeting post
retirement expenses providing financial security in the case of untimely
death of the earning member of the family creating a child education
fund and child marriage fund providing for medical expenses of self and
family Individuals today have become quite demanding when it comes to
what they are being offered in an insurance plan. There are various life
insurance plans that are available in the market to meet the
requirements of these individuals.</p>
<p>All insurance plans basically provide two kinds of benefits to an
insured person:</p>
<p>Death Cover: The amount which is paid to the nominee or beneficiary when
the insured person dies within the specified period Survival benefit:
The amount which is paid if the insured person survives the specified
period. Insurance plans.</p>
<p>In the scenario discussed above, Rahul requires an insurance plan which
can provide financial security to him and his family. He has two
options. He can either take an insurance plan that offers death cover
(Pure Term Plan) or an insurance plan which also has a survival benefit
along with death claim benefit (Endowment Plan, Money Back Plan, ULIP
etc.). An insurance plan which offers only death cover (term plan) will
provide financial security to his family in the case of his premature
death. The sum assured will be paid to the family in case Rahul dies
during the policy term .However, if he survives the term, no payment
will be made to him. Insurance plan (endowment plan) will help Rahul in
meeting his future financial requirements. In an Endowment plan, he will
receive the sum assured along with other benefits if he survives the
policy term. In case of his premature death, the sumassured will be
payable to his family (including bonus if it is &ldquo;with-profits policy).
Life is very uncertain. No one knows how many years a person will
survive nor have knowledge of his date of death. Life insurance
companies combine the features of the two basic plans Term Plan &amp; Pure
Endowment (where claim amount is payable only if the life-assured
survives the term and nothing is payable if he dies during the policy
tenure).and offer it as a single product to their customers in the form
of an &lsquo;Endowment Assurance&rsquo; Plan, which covers for both the
contingencies, of survival and death.</p>
<p>One can go in for an Endowment Assurance Plan for 25 years which will
pay the nominee / beneficiary Rs. 50 Lakhs if the insured person dies
during the tenure of the policy or pay Rs. 50 lakhs at the end of 25
years if the insured person survives the entire tenure of the policy.</p>
<p>This endowment assurance plan is nothing but a combination of the below
two plans: one pure endowment plan which will pay Rs. 50 lakhs if the
insured survives the entire tenure of the policy of 25 years and one
term assurance plan which will pay Rs. 50 lakhs if the insured dies
during the tenure of the policy Under such a plan the sum assured (SA)
is paid on survival of the specified period or on death, whichever is
earlier.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-a-traditional-plan">Features of a traditional plan</h2>
<p>All traditional plans are generally a
combination of two basic plans of insurance i.e. pure endowment and term
assurance. They provide living benefit if the insured survives the
entire tenure of the plan or death benefit in case death happens during
the tenure of the plan. A traditional plan has a set of features. By
making certain changes in these features or adding and combining some of
them, any number of plans or products can be developed by insurers by
adding special innovative features and riders etc., to make it lucrative
for customers to buy insurance.</p>

<p>Description The life insured person can be an individual adult, minor or
two or more people, jointly, under one policy. Most of the plans
stipulate a minimum sum assured amount. Some plans specify a maximum sum
assured also. Some plans don&rsquo;t specify any maximum sum assured, but this
is subject to underwriting. There can be limits on riders also. The plan
specifies when the liability will arise on the insurer to make a
payment. This can be on the death of the life insured, on the maturity
of the plan, some contingency stipulated in the riders or on some other
date. The plan also specifies whether the SA payment will be made lump
sum or in instalments. The plan specifies the minimum and maximum entry
age. Most plans also specify the maximum maturity age while whole life
plans go on till the life insured survives. Some plans specify the
minimum annual premium or the minimum instalment premium. The plan
specifies the minimum and the maximum policy tenure (duration). Whole
life plans go on till the life insured survives. Some plans provide
benefits even beyond the policy term. The plan specifies the options
available for premium payment frequency. The options can be monthly,
quarterly, half yearly, yearly or a single premium. Some plans provide
for premiums to be paid for a period less than the term. Some plans
provide the option of increasing the SA on happening of important events
like marriage, purchase of a house, childbirth or certain policy
anniversaries. This happens due to participation in surpluses and bonus
additions or due to guaranteed increases. Some plans also provide the
option of reducing the SA on happening of events like reduction of
liabilities under a mortgage, achievement of certain milestones /
objectives or certain policy anniversaries. Some plans offer additional
or supplementary benefits by way of riders in addition to the basic
cover.</p>

<h2 id="life-insurance">Life Insurance</h2>
<p>Plans The insurance plans available in the market are as
follows:</p>
<p>1.1 Term Insurance Plan The most basic insurance plan that is available
in the market is a term insurance plan. In fact term insurance is
referred to as the purest form of life insurance, as it provides
protection against risks to life. The features of term insurance are as
follows: Term insurance provides only death cover i.e. the sum assured
is paid to the beneficiary if the insured dies within the specified
period. If the insured does not die within the specified period, no
payment is made Term insurance as the name suggests provides insurance
cover for a specified term or period say 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 years as
chosen by the insured. Premiums paid under term insurance plan are
lowest as compared to the other life insurance plans Sum assured is a
pre-agreed amount between the policyholder and the insurance company.
Sum assured can be a fixed amount that is to be paid during the
specified period, or it can increase or decrease during the period. Term
insurance does not provide the savings element and hence, if the insured
person survives the term plan, he gets nothing. Term plans do not
acquire any surrender value Term insurance policy is useful in following
cases: When an individual looks for a low cost insurance without any
savings benefits, but the sole purpose is to cover financial needs of
the family in case of unfortunate premature death of the bread-winner.
When the individual is at that stage of life where insurance cover is
vital and he cannot afford a high premium. As an additional benefit,
linked with the other insurance plans. To provide cover against
financial responsibilities like mortgages and large amount of housing
loans etc. Based on the premium payment method, a term insurance plan
could be categorised as the following: Single premium term plan: insured
person pays a lump sum premium and avails the life insurance cover for a
specified period. Regular premium term plan: premium payments are to be
made at regular intervals, by the insured person for the whole term of
the policy. Premiums could be paid either monthly, quarterly,
semi-annually, or annually.</p>
<p>Based on the increasing or decreasing amount of premium payment, term
insurance plan could be categorised as: Level term insurance: the sum
assured or benefit remains constant throughout the term of the policy.
Decreasing term insurance: the sum assured or benefit decreases over the
term period and is targeted towards individuals whose financial
obligations decrease over time. In due course of time an individual
might be able to pay off the debts such as repayment of home loan, car
loan and others and hence the liabilities decrease over time. Increasing
term insurance: the sum assured increases over the term period. It is
useful when a person who is drawing a less income at the time of
commencement of risk, but whose income is expected to rise in the future
and he would be able to afford a higher premium required for the higher
benefits or sum-assured, to meet all his future liabilities. For
example, the individual gets married and has children, and hence the
liabilities increase in the form of bearing these expenses of,
children&rsquo;s education and marriage and so on.</p>
<h2 id="12-endowment-plan">1.2 Endowment Plan</h2>
<p>Pure endowment plans are exactly the opposite of term
insurance plans i.e. sum assured is paid, if the insured survives the
specified period. Insurance companies combine the benefits of term
assurance plans and pure endowment plans and sell them as Endowment
Assurance Plans which pay death cover amount if the insured dies during
the term of the policy or pay the maturity benefit if the insured
survives the entire tenure of the policy. A certain part of the premium
gets allocated towards the risk of death (mortality). After making some
deductions to meet administrative expenses etc. the balance premium is
invested to generate returns which are paid back to the policyholders in
the form of bonus.</p>
<h2 id="double-endowment-insurance-plan">Double Endowment Insurance Plan</h2>
<p>Double endowment insurance plan is a
combination of term assurance plan and double pure endowment plan under
which the amount payable on survival is double the amount payable on
death</p>
<h2 id="13-whole-life-insurance-plan">1.3 Whole Life Insurance Plan</h2>
<p>Whole life insurance plan as the name
suggests provides insurance cover for the whole life of the individual.
It could also be termed as a combination of pure endowment plan and term
insurance plan with an unspecified period, as the total term for which
the individual will live cannot be determined. The sum assured along
with bonus, if applicable, will be paid to the beneficiary on death of
the insured. Whole life insurance plans were originally designed to
provide only death benefits. There is an increased life expectancy of
the individual due to which the needs of the individuals have changed.
Hence insurance companies have started offering survival benefit with
whole life insurance plans where sum assured along with bonus will be
paid to the insured if he survives a specified term or if the insured
attains a certain age say 100 years. Commonly seen features of whole
life insurance plan The eligible age for this plan is generally between
15 years and 60 years This plan is suitable for individuals, who want to
invest in some plan, through which they can leave behind some sort of
estate as a part of their legacy to their legal heirs. The plan is

(retirement) and his wishes to leave behind some estate as a part of
inheritance for his children Whole life insurace plan can take care of
all of the above mentioned needs. In the case ofan individuals&rsquo;
premature death, the sum assured along with bonuses will be paid as lump
sum to his family (nominee). Also if he wants to leave behind an estate

<h2 id="14-money-back-insurance-plan-">1.4 Money Back Insurance Plan :</h2>
<p>Money back insurance plans are designed
to meet the requirements of the individuals who look for a product that
provides both savings and insurance cover. It is a combination of a term
assurance plan and multiple pure endowment plans. It also ensures some
form of liquidity in the form of periodic return of money as specified
in the product.</p>
<p>In a money back insurance plan, a certain percentage of the sum assured
is returned to the insured at regular intervals during the lifetime of
the policy. Money back insurance plan provides periodic payments of
partial survival benefit during the term of the policy. In case the
insured survives the specified term then he is paid the remaining
amount. If the life insured dies during the term of the policy then the
death benefit is paid along with the accumulated bonuses till then. An
important feature of this policy is that the death claim comprises full
sum assured without deduction of the survival benefit amounts, which
might have been paid as money back component. This insurance plan is
best suited to individuals, who look for periodic, regular income along
with the insurance cover. If an individual takes money back policy for
Rs 5 lakhs with a term of 20 years, then a certain percentage of this
amount becomes payable each after 5, 10, 15 years and the remaining
balance (sum assured and bonus) is payable on completion of the term
(maturity) , i.e. 20 years. Rahul has bought a money back policy with a
sum assured of Rs. 2,00,000 for tenure of 20 years. The policy specifies
a payment of 20% of the sum assured every 5 years and 40% on the
maturity of the policy. If Rahul dies after taking two survival payments
, then the insurance company, will pay the full basic sum assured of Rs.
2,00,000 without deducting the the survival benefit payments made till
the date of death., and the policy will be closed. This policy offered
by the insurance company to Rahul, if analysed, is effectively a
combination of 5 policies. 3 pure endowment plans which promise to pay
Rs. 40,000 each at the end of 5 years, 10 years and 15 years
respectively. 1 pure endowment plan which promises to pay Rs. 80,000 at
the end of 20 years. 1 term assurance plan which promises to pay Rs.
2,00,000 if Rahul dies anytime during the tenure of the policy (20
years). Comparison between money back insurance plan and endowment plan
The money back policy differs from endowment plan in the sense that in
an endowment plan, the benefit, which is the sum assured with bonus, is
payable at the end of the endowment period or on death during the term
of the policy, whereas in money back policy a certain amount is returned
in periodic instalments (unlike the endowment policy) within the policy
term as survival-benefits and on death of the life-assured.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Plans_of_Life_Insurance_32.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="15-convertible-plans">1.5 Convertible Plans</h2>
<p>Convertible insurance plans allow the insured to
convert a term insurance plan into endowment plan or whole life plan or
any other conversion as allowed by the insurance company within a
specified period. These policies have two advantages: The individual can
choose to pay low premium in the beginning with term plan and later on
convert the plan into endowment and choose to pay higher amount of
premium. No underwriting would be necessary at the time of plan
conversion from term plan to the endowment one. A convertible whole life
plan can also be changed to an endowment plan. In case it is not
converted, it continues as the original plan. This type of plan has two
advantages. With the increase in income, the life assured would be able
to afford higher amount of premium in later stages and also there will
be no underwriting at a later stage when he decides to convert the plan.
The medical ailments that the insured suffers, after the policy has been
issued, will not affect the benefits associated with the insurance plan.</p>
<h2 id="16-with-profit-and-without-profit-insurance-plans">1.6 With Profit and Without Profit Insurance Plans</h2>
<p>Under whole life and
endowment insurance plans, the insured can choose to receive profits or
bonus along with the sum assured. These are known as with profit or
participatory policies. The premium of these policies is higher as the
insured gets the benefit of bonus along with the sum assured. Hence the
insured participates in the profit of the insurer. Under without profit
or non-participatory insurance plans, the insured will not be entitled
to profits or bonus which is declared after actuarial valuation. Pure
term insurance policies are without profit policies and their premium is
lesser as compared to with profit policies.</p>
<h2 id="17-joint-life-insurance">1.7 Joint Life Insurance</h2>
<h2 id="18-child-insurance-plan">Plans Joint life policies provide life cover for two lives
simultaneously. This policy is very useful for married couples or
business partners. There can be many variations in the joint-life
products that the insurers have made available. The features of this
policy commonly comprise of the following features: The sum assured is
paid on the death of the first joint policyholder. The sum assured is
payable again in the case of death of the survivor during the term of
the policy. No further premiums are to be paid after the death of the
first policyholder or at the end of the policy term whichever is
earlier. Vested bonus along with the sum assured is paid to the
beneficiary after the death of the survivor. If either of the policy
holders survives the policy term, then the sum assured along with the
vested bonus is payable to him / her on maturity date. Proposal has to
be signed jointly by both the persons getting insured Each person to be
insured will be underwritten separately. Both the persons will have to
undergo a medical examination, unless the policy offers insurance
without any medical examination. Premiums depend on the age of both the
persons getting insured.
1.8 Child Insurance Plan</h2>
<p>In case of a child
insurance plan, the premium is paid by the parent to fund the child&rsquo;s
future requirements like education and marriage expenses. In case of
unfortunate death of the parent during the term of the plan the child&rsquo;s
future does not suffer. The insurance company generally continues the
insurance plan and pays the premium.</p>
<h2 id="deferment-period">Child plan assists the parents in accumulating sufficient wealth for
their children&rsquo;s future. Also child plan secures the child&rsquo;s future, in
case of any unfortunate event. The main worry of the parents is securing
their child&rsquo;s future, if something untoward happens to them. The main
features of this plan are:
Deferment period:</h2>
<p>it is the duration between
the commencement of policy and the commencement of risk. It is the
duration for which one has to wait before the benefits of the insurance
plan actually begin. There is no insurance cover during the deferment
period. If the child dies during this period, only premiums paid will be
returned.
Deferred date: the date on which risk commences. This is the
date from which the insurance cover on the child becomes applicable.
From this date the insurance cover is applicable to the child.
Commencement of the risk: risk will commence automatically on the
deferment date. No medical examination is necessary. Premiums: Since the
child is a minor when the policy is taken, the premium of the plans is
quite low. The premiums are to be paid by the parents as they are the
owners of the policy, till the vesting date. Vesting: the process of
passing the title of the insurance policy to the insured child, once he
turns major (18 years) is known as vesting. Vesting date: it is the date
on which the child completes 18 years of age and the title of the policy
passes to the insured child. The policy now becomes a contract between
the insured (the child) and the insurer. The deferred date and the
vesting date need not be same. Age of the child: child insurance
policies could be taken for the child aged a few months and above,
however risk on the life of the child begins only at a specified age, as
various plans are now available in the market. Waiver of premium: there
are certain benefits available with the plan where the premiums can be
waived, in case the proposer of the policy dies during the term of the
policy. This benefit is available as a rider-benefit and is generally
optional in nature but is also available sometimes as a bundled product
where this is a part of the product feature .In cases, where the premium
waiver is available, generally the proposer has to be medically
underwritten and waiver of premium facility needs to be granted by the
underwriter after an underwriting process.</p>
<p>The Premium Waiver benefit is not applicable in the case the proposer
commits suicide within one year of the policy.</p>
<p>Rahul&rsquo;s son Jagat is 2 years old. Rahul decides to buy a child insurance
plan for Jagat, wherein the risk cover starts at age 7 years As Jagat is
two years old, the life cover on Jagat will not start till he turns
seven. On the premium being paid by Rahul, no mortality charges will be
deducted at this stage as the life cover on Jagat has not yet commenced.
The first policy anniversary after Jagat&rsquo;s seventh birthday will be the
deferred date on which the risk on Jagat&rsquo;s life will be commenced i.e.
the insurance cover on the child will become applicable. The day on
which Jagat will th celebrate his 18 birthday, the title of the policy
passes automatically to Jagat. This th process is called vesting. Hence
the first anniversary of the policy after Jagat&rsquo;s 18 birthday will be
the vesting date. After vesting, the contract will now be between Jagat
and the insurance company. Jagat now has a right to nominate a person
under this policy.</p>

<h2 id="learning-outcome-b">2. Understand the importance of ULIPs.
[Learning Outcome b]</h2>
<p>A unit linked insurance plan (ULIP) is an insurance plan which is a combination
of insurance protection and investment.</p>
<p>A ULIP can be an ideal investment vehicle for people who are looking for
the triple benefits of: insurance protection investment and income tax
benefits ULIP Premium The premium paid by the insured in a ULIP is
divided into 3 parts: Expenses: A portion of the premium that goes
towards meeting the expenses of issuing the policy like agent&rsquo;'
commission, policy set-up costs, administrative costs, and statutory
levies. Mortality: A portion of the premium goes towards covering the
risk of providing life cover to the life assured. Investment: After
deduction of the two amounts mentioned above, the balance premium goes
towards investment on behalf of the life-assured as per the choices of
funds he has indicated.</p>
<p>The policyholder can select from various funds available to invest his
premium. Some of them are indicated below: Equity Fund Debt Fund
Balanced Fund Money Market Fund These are the basic funds offered by
insurance companies. They may offer the investor a choice of more funds
to select from which may be variants or combination of the above four
funds. Insurance companies call these funds with different names. A ULIP
is effectively two plans. One plan covers the risk of providing
protection to the life insured. The second plan acts like a mutual fund
where the life insured can make regular investments. Generally, on
maturity, the fund value is paid. On the death of the life insured
during the tenure of the policy either the sum assured or the fund
value, whichever is higher, is paid. Some insurance companies have the
provision to pay both. &ldquo;Switching&rdquo; and &ldquo;Redirection&rdquo; are two options
available to the policyholders under the &ldquo;ULIP&rdquo; policy whereby they can
choose the kind of funds to be invested. The investments in ULIPs are
termed as units and Net Asset Value (NAV) refers to the value of each
unit of the fund on a certain day. The premiums collected from various
individuals are pooled together in a unit fund. The following are the
types of charges that are applicable to ULIP policy and these have to
follow regulatory norms: Premium Allocation Charges (PAC) Mortality
Charges Fund Management Charges (FMC) Policy Administration Charges
Surrender Charges Fund Switching Charges (Details of the ULIPs are
explained in detail in subsequent chapters)</p>
<p>Question 2 In a ULIP NAV stands for __________ New Asset Value

<h2 id="learning-outcome-c">3. Understand the importance of riders.
[Learning Outcome c]</h2>
<p>Concept of Riders A rider is an additional clause or condition added to the base
policy that gives additional (add-on) benefit to the buyer. Riders can
be compared to choice of different toppings in a pizza. A base policy is
like a pizza base and choice of riders is like choice of different pizza
toppings available to customize the pizza as per an individual&rsquo;s
requirement. Riders help to customize different requirements of a person
into a single Diagram 4: Choice of riders</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Plans_of_Life_Insurance_34.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Features Enhanced protection: riders enable a person to enhance the
scope of protection offered by a policy, qualitatively and
quantitatively. No underwriting: Generally, riders do not involve set up
costs like underwriting. Low cost: No bonus is paid on riders. Hence the
premium payable on riders is very low. Income tax deduction: the premium
paid for riders qualifies for tax deduction under Section 80C or Section
80D (based on type of rider) of the Income Tax Act. These depend on
prevalent tax laws. Maximum limit: amount of cover under a rider cannot
be more than the base policy cover amount. Some examples of riders are
as follows: Increased death benefit rider: this rider is more beneficial
for primary earning members of the family. The benefit from this rider
is that the policyholder can increase his death cover as his liabilities
increase. Hence in case of premature death of the insured, the
beneficiary gets more money than the normal sum assured. Critical
illness rider: this rider helps if the insured falls sick and requires
hospitalisation and undergoes a major treatment due to a critical
illness. The critical illness rider provides protection against major
illnesses and diseases. Insurance companies specify the list of
illnesses covered and exclusions under this rider. If the insured is
diagnosed with any of these illnesses the rider amount is paid either in
lump sum or in instalments. Some of the commonly covered critical
illnesses under CI rider are : Heart attack Kidney failure Cancer
Cardiac surgery Paralytic stroke Major organ transplant The products of
different companies could have CI covering varied conditions and
diseases and their definitions too could vary. Major surgical assistance
benefit: This rider provides financial support in the event of medical
emergencies that require surgery and a part of the sum assured is paid
to the policyholder.</p>
<p>Accidental Death Benefit (ADB) rider: This rider helps if the insured
meets with an accident and becomes permanently disabled or dies. This
rider covers the risk of disability or death due to accident. In case of
death due to accident this rider provides additional benefit over and
above the base policy cover amount. Waiver of premium rider: This rider
helps if the insured becomes disabled and loses his income earning
capacity. In such a state it would be difficult for him to pay the
premium of his policy. Till the time the insured recovers and becomes
employed once again, the insurance company gives up the right to collect
premium or waives off the premium under this rider. Guaranteed
insurability option rider: Choosing this rider helps in increasing the
insurance cover at regular intervals, without further medical
examination. This option could be exercised, by young individuals, when
their earnings are low, and with time, when their income increases,
along with their liabilities, they can buy additional insurance cover.
So even if one develops some kind of medical illness in due course of
time, the insured can increase his insurance cover without undergoing
any medical check-ups. Disability income benefit rider: if the insured
becomes disabled (falling within the scope of the definition), this
rider provides a monthly income benefit to him. At the time of taking
this rider the insurer specifies a fixed monthly disability income
benefit amount or the monthly benefit amount can be linked to the sum
assured (SA).</p>
<p>Question 3 If the insured person has taken
____________________, then in case of his accidental
death, the beneficiaries would receive additional amount over and above
the normal sum assured. Critical illness rider Guaranteed insurability
rider Accident death benefit rider Waiver of premium rider</p>
<p>Life insurance companies&rsquo; aim is to provide insurance cover to maximum
number of individuals and at the same time ensure that their business
remains profitable. They constantly try to identify the various needs of
individuals as well as corporate customers and accordingly try to
innovate and come out with new products to cater to the needs of
different sections of society. Apart from the basic insurance plans that
we have discussed till now, insurance companies also offer some special
need based plans that are quite unique in their conceptual design and
differ in a lot of ways from the other basic insurance plans. In the
past, the insurance companies in the US identified the need for
insurance among industrial workers. These were low wage earners and
hence could afford to pay only a minimal premium. Several insurance
companies launched insurance schemes for them, but they were all
unsuccessful, until the launch of industrial life insurance by
Prudential Insurance Company. Industrial life insurance, offered a
modest insurance cover for a small premium, which these industrial
workers were supposed to pay weekly. The feature that differentiated
this scheme from others was that Prudential appointed agents who were
responsible for collection of premium from the policyholder&rsquo;s home every
week. In the earlier policies, the industrial workers found it
inconvenient to visit the insurance office to pay the premiums on a
regular basis. This led to high rate of default in premium payment.
Hence the simple solution of door to door collection of premiums from
the policyholders made industrial life insurance scheme one of the most
successful insurance schemes. The above scenario highlights how if
insurance companies come out with a special needs product for a specific
segment and make it convenient for the customer (premium collection from
home), the product can become successful.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-d">4. Learn about industrial life insurance.
[Learning Outcome d]</h2>
<p>Industrial life insurance refers to a low cost insurance plan. Premiums
are of small amounts that are paid monthly or normally weekly. The
insurance coverage is modest and the benefit offered with the policy is
either cash benefit on maturity or death cover in case of death before
the tenure of the policy ends. Such products by insurance companies are
important as they provide insurance cover to low income families.</p>
<p>Working of industrial life insurance: The areas for procuring business
are divided among the insurance agents. These agents are responsible for
collection of premiums from the policyholders residing in that area. The
agent has to visit each policyholder individually and collect the
premium. After collecting the premium the agent duly signs the receipt
book with the policyholder as a proof that the premium has been
collected by him. The important features of industrial life insurance
are as follows: The industrial life insurance plan targets low income
groups. The agents who are appointed for the purpose collect the
premiums door to door from the policyholders. The premiums need to be
collected weekly or monthly. The agent generally visits the policyholder
on the day the insured receives salary or wages. Receipt books: the
policyholders are issued a receipt book each. The agent makes an entry
into the receipt book when he collects the premium. The agent has to
sign the receipt book as a proof that the payment has been collected by
him. Debit list: this list contains the details of policyholders from
whom the premiums have to be collected. The policyholders would be of
one area only, who may be insured by the same agent or by some other
agent. Industrial life insurance is not very popular now-a- days as the
mortality rate of low income workers is high as compared to other
segments. The administrative cost of industrial insurance is also high
as the agent has to personally visit each policyholder every week to
collect the premiums.</p>

consists of the details of the policyholders from whom the premium needs
to be collected. Receipt list Debit list Collection list Policyholder&rsquo;s

[Learning Outcome e]</h2>
<p>MWP Act
According to the Married Women&rsquo;s Property Act or MWP Act 1874, Section
6, A policy of insurance effected by any married man on his own life,
and expressed on the face of it to be for the benefit of his wife, his
wife and children, or any of them shall ensure and be deemed to be a
trust for the benefit of his wife, his wife and children, or any of them
according to the interests expressed, and shall not, so long as any
object of the trust remains, be subject to the control of the life
insured, or his creditors, or form part of his estate The term
&lsquo;Children&rsquo; in the Act refers to the &ndash; sons and daughters both natural
and adopted. The term &ldquo;married man&rdquo; includes a widower or a divorced
man. Married Women&rsquo;s Property Act provides an easy process by which a
married man can leave his inheritance to his dependents. Also the Act
provides statutory privileges to the dependents, through which they can
seek higher amount of protection in case of any dispute for the claim on
the death of the insured.</p>
<p>Eligibility for MWP Policy (under Married Women&rsquo;s Property Act) The
policy under MWP can be taken by Any married man who wants to safeguard
the interest of his dependents, wife and children, can purchase this
scheme. A divorcee or widower can also purchase the scheme, seeking
protection for his children.</p>
<h2 id="beneficiaries">Beneficiaries:</h2>
<p>Following person can be beneficiaries under this scheme:
Only the wife Any one or more children Wife and any one or more children
jointly If the individual decides to provide the benefit to two or more
persons, then in this case equal or unequal shares could be given to the
beneficiaries. Non Mohammedan The individual can form a trust in the
name of his wife or in the name of his children. The individual has the
freedom to decide as to whether he wishes to provide benefits to all of
his children or only some. People whose names are mentioned in the trust
will only be entitled to the benefits.</p>
<p>Rajat is a married man with three children &ndash; one son and two daughters.
He wants to bring his life insurance policies under the provisions of
MWP Act. He submits an addendum for formation of trust, and includes his
wife and his son as the beneficiaries and excludes the two daughters
from the beneficiaries&rsquo; names. In this case, the daughters will not be
entitled for any claim. The individual can provide the name of the
beneficiaries who will be entitled to the claim. The benefits will be
shared by the beneficiaries jointly, or the survivors or the survivor
among them. In this case only the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries
will be entitled to the claim.</p>
<p>Mohan is a married man with two sons. He has chosen to affect his
insurance policies under MWP Act, and named his wife, and two sons as
joint beneficiaries. Mohan and his wife along with his younger son die
in a car accident. In this case, the only survivor is his elder son.
Hence he will be the only surviving beneficiary who will be entitled to

the wife and the children should be named persons and must be existing
on the date of the policy. In case there are two or more than two
beneficiaries, the proposer cannot mention that the benefit could go to
them jointly or to the survivors or survivor of them. He should define
the total share of each beneficiary.</p>

cannot be taken under MWP Act.
Loan</h2>
<p>No loan can be granted under a MWP
Act policy unless the proposer had while appointing the trustees, unless
specifically authorised the trustees to obtain loan on the policy. The
trustees cannot surrender the policy.</p>
<p>Process of affecting the life insurance policies under MWP Act: Addendum
to insurance company: when an individual decides to obtain insurance
under MWP Act, he has to submit an addendum to the insurance company.
For such a policy, he will not be able to nominate anybody, as the
policy is issued under the MWP Act. Appointment of the trustees: the
life insured has to appoint a Trustee. The individual need not appoint
an individual trustee; he also has the option of appointing corporate
trustee as well. The life insured may reserve the power to revoke the
appointment of trustee and appoint another one. In case he wishes to
change the trustees in future, he needs to add a provision for the same
in the addendum. Payment of claim under MWP Act In an MWP Act policy,
when a claim arises, the policy money will be assigned to either the
beneficiary or the trustees as specified in the policy. The trustees
hold the policy money for the beneficiary. In case the beneficiary is
dead, his legal heirs will be entitled for the claim.</p>

<p>Keyman insurance Key man insurance is the insurance cover extended to an
important or key employee of the company, the loss of whom can affect
the operations and profitability of the company. Key man refers to an
employee, having special skill set or significant responsibilities. His
contribution to the company is quite extensive. In case of death of the
key man, two types of losses could be suffered by the company: Loss in
profits Expense involved in replacement of the key man.</p>
<p>Features of key man insurance Based on IRDA guidelines, only Term plan
can be bought under the key man insurance. The employer is the
policyholder and hence pays the premium The key man is the life insured
In case something happens to the key man, the claim will be paid to the
employer (policyholder) and not the insured. The company gets the money
to recover from losses. The premium paid under the key man insurance by
the company is treated as business expense and the company can claim
deduction from taxable income. The proceeds received by the employer
from the policy are taxable</p>

<p>Over the last few years our economy has done well leading to good GDP
growth. This has led to the rise in disposable income and better quality
living standards. The increase in life expectancy exposes a person to
health problems and diseases with increase in age. For an average
person, in their retirement years, they do not have the income to meet
healthcare costs. Moreover, healthcare costs have soared in the last few
years. This leads to a double blow to the person who falls prey to
critical illnesses or other diseases which require hospitalisation and
result in huge medical bills. This underlines the importance of health
insurance which is gaining popularity among the masses.</p>
<p>The health insurance products available in the market today come in many
variations and combinations and are sold by many Life and Health
insurance companies</p>
<h2 id="cashless-treatment">Cashless Treatment</h2>
<p>In the case of medical
emergencies, it is often difficult to find immediate cash to meet the
medical expenses. Health insurance covers treatment costs which require
hospitalisation (including domiciliary treatment). Health insurance
companies tie up with hospitals across the country and include them in
their network. Insurance companies issue cashless cards to the insured
which does not require them to pay for treatment (allowed costs) when
admitted to one of the network hospitals. If the insured gets admitted
to a non-network hospital then they have to pay the hospital bill and
claim the amount from the insurance company on a reimbursement basis.
Healthcare policies are generally available in three variants:
Individual Policy: this type of health insurance policy caters to the
medical needs of only one individual. For example, Ram has taken a
health insurance policy from Company ABC for a sum of Rs. 2,00,000 by
paying a premium of Rs. 4,000. Under this policy, Ram will be covered
against expenses for any illness (covered as per the policy terms) which
requires him to be hospitalised, up to a limit of Rs. 2,00,000 in that
particular year. Family Floater Policy: this type of health insurance
policy caters to the medical needs of a family. In family floater
policies, normally insurance companies allow coverage for up to two
adults and two children in a family. The sum insured can be shared by
the family members covered in the policy. There are no fixed proportions
in which the sum insured is shared by the family members. For example,
Amit has taken a Family Floater Policy from Company ABC for Rs. 3,00,000
for his family. The policy covers Amit, his wife and his two children.
In this policy, the sum assured of Rs. 3,00,000 will be shared by all
the four members of the family in no fixed proportion. It can happen
that Amit&rsquo;s wife suffers a heart attack and the entire Rs. 3,00,000 is
used up for her treatment. Group Policy: this type of health insurance
policy caters to the medical needs of a group of people brought together
for a common objective or purpose.</p>
<p>For example, Company XYZ has taken a group health insurance policy from
Company ABC for all their employees. This policy will take care of
medical needs of the employees of Company XYZ up to a fixed amount, say
Rs 2,00,000. Diagram 5: Types of Health Insurance Plans</p>

<p>Healthcare policies normally have some exclusions such as dental
treatment, diagnostic tests, expenses on vitamins, cosmetic treatment,
homeopathic treatment etc. These policies also, exclude treatment for
diseases prevalent at the time of taking the policy for the first time
or contracted within 30 days of such commencement. These diseases are
termed as pre-existing illnesses by health insurance companies. If there
is no claim during the year the insurance company gives a discount on
the renewal premium or keeps the premium same and increases the sum
assured, which is known as &lsquo;No-Claim Bonus&rsquo;. Health insurance generally
provides cover for treatment of the following: Hospitalisation: the
hospitalisation charges are paid by the insurance company if the insured
is hospitalised for more than 24 hours. Insurance is provided for pre
and post hospitalisation treatment as well. ICU treatment: if the
insured it to be treated in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) then some
companies have a provision of additional payment provided the insured
has paid the additional premium for the same. Some health insurance
companies also provide additional &lsquo;Critical Illness Cover&rsquo; which can be
specifically used to treat critical illnesses over and above the normal
sum assured for extra premium payment. Surgery: a fixed lump sum amount
is payable if the insured has to go undergo some listed surgery.
Recuperating expenses: some insurance companies pay the post
hospitalisation benefit to help the individuals meet expenses like
follow up tests and medical consultations. Health check-up: some health
insurance companies also provide annual health check-up on regular basis
as part of the policy.</p>
<p>Day care expenses: there are some treatments which do require less than
24 hours hospitalisation. Such treatments are covered under day care
expenses if they are covered under the policy. Hospitalisation cash
policy: both life insurance companies and non-life insurance companies
provide this policy. This policy only covers the hospitalisation
expenses and excludes other medical expenses. The insured gets a lump
sum payment for hospitalisation on a daily basis. The hospitalisation
charges are payable by the insurance company if the insured is
hospitalised for more than 24 hours.</p>
<p>Question 6 Which of the following plan provides health cover for the
entire family? Critical care plan Family floater plan Group insurance
plan Mediclaim</p>
<p>Summary Death cover: amount paid by the insurer to the nominee /
beneficiary on the death of the life insured during the tenure of the
policy. Survival benefit: amount paid by the insurer to the insured on
the maturity of the policy. Sum assured is a pre-agreed amount between
the insured and insurer; payable by the insurer on the happening of a
specific event. The premium is based on sum assured and could be paid
either as a lump sum payment or could be paid periodically (monthly,
quarterly, semi-annually or annually). Term insurance provides only
death cover i.e. the sum assured is paid to the nominee / beneficiary if
the insured dies during the tenure of the policy. In an endowment
assurance plan sum assured is paid to the nominee / beneficiary on the
death of the life insured or to the life insured on the maturity of the
policy. Whole life insurance plan provides insurance cover for entire
lifetime of an individual.</p>
<p>In a money back plan, a certain percentage of the sum assured is
returned to the insured at specific intervals during the lifetime of the
policy. ULIPs provide the triple benefits of life cover, returns and tax
benefits. A rider is an additional clause or condition added to the base
policy that gives additional (add-on) benefit to the buyer. Industrial
life insurance refers to a low cost insurance plan for low income groups
working in industries. Key man insurance is the insurance cover extended
to an important employee of the company, the loss of whom can affect the
operations and profitability of the company. Health insurance provides
insurance cover for meeting medical emergencies that require
hospitalisation.</p>
