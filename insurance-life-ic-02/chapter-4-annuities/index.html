<meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER 4 ANNUITIES Chapter Introduction Retirement planning is an important tool for an individual, which helps them to be financially independent even after retirement. Government employees are more secure in this sense as they receive regular pension from their employers after retirement. But now-a-days, there is an increase in the workforce of people who are either self-employed or work in private companies that do not offer pensions to its employees.

<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>Retirement planning is an important tool
for an individual, which helps them to be financially independent even
after retirement. Government employees are more secure in this sense as
they receive regular pension from their employers after retirement. But
now-a-days, there is an increase in the workforce of people who are
either self-employed or work in private companies that do not offer
pensions to its employees. Hence the biggest worry for these individuals
is to plan for their retirement. A proper retirement plan has therefore
become necessary. Insurance companies now offer annuity products as a
retirement solution to these self-employed individuals and salaried
employees working in private companies. Annuity provides regular income
or pension at the chosen retirement age. In this chapter, we will study
the annuity products, their features and benefits.</p>

<p>Sharad Sharma is an executive engineer who works
for a private electronics firm. He is 33 years old and wants to retire
at the age of 60. Sharad and his wife are able to maintain quite a
comfortable lifestyle in their present salaries. However, he wants to
make sure that he invests the money prudently and earns a regular income
after his retirement. He feels that regular income received throughout
his lifetime will provide the necessary financial liquidity to meet his
monthly expenses. He therefore wants to go for an investment plan that
provides him with regular income in the form of pension after his
retirement, and also lets him maintain his standard of living that he
enjoyed prior to his retirement.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-a">1. Understand the concept of annuity.
[Learning Outcome a]</h2>
<p>Annuities are investments made by an individual with the aim of receiving regular
income on a periodic basis after a specified period or immediately.
Individuals invest in annuity to meet their post retirement or old age
financial needs. The concept of annuity is similar to pension, which an
employee receives from their employer after retirement. Pension is the
regular payment that is received by an employee after their retirement.
But some private sector employees or self-employed persons do not enjoy
the benefits of pension from employers. Insurance companies offer
annuity plans for such individuals. The annuity is purchased by an
individual from the insurance company and in return, the insurance
company provides regular income (pension) to the individual. Hence,
annuity is also known as a pension plan. Annuities vs. Insurance plans
Both annuities and insurance plans are sold by insurance companies, but
the similarity between the two ends there. An insurance plan is a
contract between an individual and the insurance company, in which the
individual pays premiums for a specified period, against which the
insurance company provides insurance cover to the individual. The
insurance company makes a lump sum payment to the beneficiaries on the
death of the individual, or to the individual on completion of the
policy term. Annuity is a contract between an individual and the
insurance company, in which the individual pays a lump-sum amount or
regular payments to the insurance company and at the end of a specified
period, the insurance company provides regular income to the individual.</p>
<p>Some important terms used in an annuity:
Annuitant: an individual investing in annuity is known as an annuitant. Annuity income: the
annuity (periodic amount) that is paid to the annuitant is annuity
income. It can also be referred to as pension, allowance or income.
Annuitise: to start the pension or annuity, an individual has to
annuitise. Annuitising means instructing the insurance company to start
the periodic payments. Deferment period: once the contract between the
annuitant and the insurance company commences, the insurance company can
start paying the annuity immediately, or after a specified period of
time, or from a certain age. Such specified period, from the date the
annuity contract begins till the actual annuity payments begin, is
called deferment period. Vesting date: the date from which the annuitant
starts receiving regular income is known as the vesting date. This date
generally coincides with the retirement date of the annuitant.
Commutation: on the vesting date, the annuitant has two choices. The
annuitant can either start receiving the regular annuity payment from
the insurance rd company or withdraw 1/3 of the total accumulated amount
as a lump sum payment (commuted value) from the remaining balance, and
request the insurance company to pay out regular annuity payments. This
process is known as commutation Commuted value: at the beginning of the
annuity, the lump sum that the annuitant withdraws is known as the
commuted value.</p>
<p>Mihir has been investing in an annuity plan for the past 10 years. On
completion of the deferred period of 10 years, his annuity contract with
the insurance company will th th commence (i.e. on 12 September 2010).
Hence 12 September 2010 is the vesting date for Mihir&rsquo;s contract. If on
this day he decides to withdraw a certain percent of his investments
(commutation amount), then the remaining 75 percent will be used by the
insurance company to provide regular payments (annuities) to Mihir. In
the above scenario: Mihir is the annuitant. Deferment period is the 10
year period for which Mihir pays the premium. th Vesting date is 12
September 2010, when the annuity contract commences. Commuted value:
withdrawal of a certain percent of the accumulated amount. Commutation:
the process of withdrawal of money. If Mihir decides to exercise
commutation, then the income that he will receive from the insurance
company will be lesser than what he had originally planned out of the
whole corpus.</p>
<p>The main features of annuity can be summed up as below: Individuals
purchase annuities to get a regular source of income (pension) after
retirement or after certain age. The annuitant can pay premium to an
insurance company either in lump sum or in instalments. No medical
check-up is required for taking an annuity policy. The insurance company
and the annuitant can mutually decide the annuity payment which can be
either monthly, semi-annually or annually, as preferred by the
annuitant. The annuity plans offered by insurance companies are very
flexible. Annuity plans can either continue for the annuitant&rsquo;s whole
life or or a fixed number of years or fixed number of years / life or in
the case of joint life policy; till the joint applicant survives The
amount that the annuitant pays as premium for annuity to insurance
companies depends upon several factors such as: the regular income that
the annuitant expects at the time of retirement: the premium amount
depends upon the current income of the individual and the amount that
they can spare towards premium payment. the amount that they have
invested in other schemes and the returns that they expect: this helps
the annuitant in evaluating the income they expect to receive in future
and the amount they require for retirement. Their future financial
liabilities such as home loan, child education, medical expenses etc.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Annuities_41.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>On the basis of premium payment: the annuitant has the option of making
the premium payment either as a lump sum amount or in instalments. Based
on the method of premium payment, an annuity could be categorised as
follows: Single premium payment: in this type of annuity an annuitant
pays a lump sum amount as a single premium. This is preferred by
individuals who are nearing retirement and who have not made any prior
investments for meeting post retirement obligations. On retirement, the
individuals can invest their savings by purchasing an annuity plan. In
return, the insurance company can start paying pension immediately after
receiving the payment. Salaried employees receive provident fund money
on retirement, which they can put in an annuity plan. Amol is retiring
in February next year and is worried about his post retirement financial
obligations. He has accumulated a substantial amount in his provident
fund account, which he plans to use after his retirement. He is looking
for some investment avenue where his money can be safe and that can
provide regular payments to meet his post retirement expenses. Amol can
select an annuity plan to invest his provident fund amount. The premium
can be paid as a lump-sum. Once he pays the premium, he can immediately
start receiving pension from the insurance company. Multiple premium
payment: here, the annuitant makes a series of payments to the insurance
company. This kind of premium payment method is preferred by young
salaried individuals, who choose to make the payment of annuity premiums
in instalments and do not expect the returns immediately. They continue
to make regular periodic payments of premiums in instalments, till
retirement or till a specific time. The insurance company starts paying
the pension after the deferred period to the annuitant. Dr. Mukund Gupta
is a reputed paediatrician who runs a private clinic. Over the years he
has built quite a name for himself. Though he earns good regular income
and has invested it prudently in various investments, he is concerned
about his post retirement financial obligations. As he is in private
practice he would not be able to enjoy pension after his retirement. Dr
Mukund Gupta can choose to purchase an annuity plan, where he can pay
monthly instalments for a specific period and after retirement, he can
choose to receive regular pension.</p>
<h2 id="2-on-the-basis-of-payment-of-annuity">2. On the basis of payment of annuity</h2>
<p>Life annuity: in life annuity the
insurance company promises to pay a certain amount of annuity to the
annuitant as long as he / she lives. The annuity payment stops on death
of the annuitant, and the rest of the accumulated fund is returned to
his beneficiary. Mehul Kumar works as an executive engineer with a
leading construction firm. He has invested money in an annuity and has
chosen the option of annuity for life. In this scheme, he will start
receiving pension after retirement for as long as he lives. The
insurance company will cease the payment on his death. In case at the
time of the death there are some funds left with the company, that
amount will be returned to Mehul&rsquo;s beneficiaries. Annuity certain and
life thereafter: in this option, the insurance company promises payment
of fixed annuity for a fixed term. In case the annuitant dies during the
specified term, the remaining amount will be paid to the nominees. In
this option, the annuitant can choose to receive annuity payments for
some specific period, say 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 years irrespective of
survival of annuitant and if the annuitant survives the chosen annuity
certain period, the annuity will be paid for life thereafter. Rakesh
Sharma is an executive working in a leading MNC. He has chosen to
purchase an annuity guaranteed for a fixed period of 20 years. That
means he will receive pension for 20 years. In case he dies after 12
years, the annuity will be paid to his beneficiaries for the remaining 8
years. In case he survives for more than 20 years, then in this case,
the insurance company will pay annuity for the chosen term of 20years
and stop the annuity payment after the completion of the specified
tenure. Joint life last survivor annuity: in this option annuity is paid
to the annuitant for their entire life. On the death of the annuitant,
50% of the pension will be paid to the spouse for as long as the spouse
lives. A variation of joint life annuity allows annuity payment during
the lifetime of the annuitant or their spouse, whoever lives longer.
Annuity for life with return of premiums: in this option, annuity is
paid to the annuitant as long as they live and on their death, premiums
are returned to the nominee or legal heirs.</p>

<p>Immediate annuity: this type of
annuity is taken when the individual wants to start receiving the
annuity immediately. Here, the individual starts receiving annuity
payments as soon as the annuity product is bought. The annuitant has to
make a lump sum payment for receiving immediate annuity. Deferred
annuity: when an individual wishes to receive annuity payment after
certain specified period, they can choose deferred annuity. This
specified period is referred to as deferment period. The annuitant can
either make a lump sum payment at the time of commencement of contract,
or make payment in instalments, during the deferment period. The
insurance company returns the amount of premium paid to the
beneficiaries of the annuitant, in case the annuitant dies during the
deferment period. The annuity commences at the end of the deferment
period, on a date which is known as the vesting date.</p>

<p>Fixed Annuity: in fixed annuity the insurance company
promises to pay a fixed amount of annuity for a certain period of time
or life thereafter. Fixed annuity guarantees the amount of annuity. The
investment is made in low risk securities like government bonds. In
immediate annuity, the insurance company will begin regular annuity
payments immediately after the lump sum payment is made by the
annuitant, whereas in deferred annuity, the payment will be made after a
period of time, say after the annuitant retires. Variable annuity: in a
variable return annuity, the payment made by the insurance company
depends upon the performance of the investment option that is chosen by
the annuitant. In a variable annuity plan, the investments are generally
made in mutual funds, money market instruments, stocks and bonds. The
variable annuity helps the annuitant to participate in the growth of the
investment avenue chosen. The premium that is paid by the annuitant is
invested by the insurance company based on the investment option chosen
by the annuitant.</p>

assured income to an individual after retirement depending on the plan
chosen by the annuitant. Diversified portfolio: annuities are an
excellent option for diversifying one&rsquo;s investment portfolio. Immediate
payment option: if an individual is nearing retirement and has not been
able to save much, then one can choose to start receiving annuities
immediately by making a lump sum payment. With the rising cost of
living, an individual needs a regular source of income after retirement
to meet their daily expenses and maintain a certain standard of living.
Annuity provides the necessary financial independence after retirement
to meet the monthly expenses. Disadvantages of annuity The money
invested in annuity gets blocked till retirement. There could be certain
situations, where the need for a lump sum amount may arise such as:
Payment for medical treatment, where a lump sum payment has to be made
urgently. The annuitant wants to invest in some physical assets such as
car, land or house.</p>
<p>A new investment scheme which promises good returns has been launched by
a company, and the annuitant wishes to invest in the scheme If the
person withdraws a certain amount of money invested on the vesting date
(commutation), then the return income (annuity) will reduce, and might
not be sufficient to meet requirements.</p>
<p>Question 3 Which of the following is a disadvantage of investing in
annuity? Regular payment after retirement Money gets blocked till
retirement Provides financial independence An option for diversifying
the portfolio</p>
<p>Summary Annuities are investments made by an individual with the aim of
receiving regular income on a periodic basis either immediately or after
a specified period. An individual investing in annuities is known as an
annuitant. To annuitise means to instruct the insurance company to start
the periodic annuity payment. The date from which the annuitant starts
receiving regular income is known as the vesting date. Commutation
refers to the process where the annuitant can withdraw a certain portion
of the money (as a lump sum) from their accumulated fund on the vesting
date. An insurance company has to make the payment monthly, quarterly,
semiannually or annually, as preferred by the annuitant. There are
various options for receiving annuity payments at the retirement age
such as for a fixed term, for life, etc.</p>
