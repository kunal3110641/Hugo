<meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER 2 PREMIUMS AND BONUSES Chapter Introduction Most insurance companies operate with the aim of earning profits and rewarding their policyholders and shareholders. The biggest worry for insurance companies is to maintain solvency i.e. income earned by the company should be enough to recover the cost of expenses and liabilities. If the income earned is more than the required amount to meet expenses and liabilities then the company is said to have earned profits." />

<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Most insurance companies operate with the aim of earning profits and rewarding their
policyholders and shareholders. The biggest worry for insurance
companies is to maintain solvency i.e. income earned by the company
should be enough to recover the cost of expenses and liabilities. If the
income earned is more than the required amount to meet expenses and
liabilities then the company is said to have earned profits. The
premiums charged are the prime source of income for the insurance
company. An inadequate amount of premium collected can affect the entire
operations of the business making it unviable. In this chapter we will
try to understand the concept of premium and analyse the ways in which
companies recover cost by arriving at appropriate premiums. We will also
explore the concept of bonus and learn the difference between simple
revisionary bonus and compound revisionary bonus.

<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this scenario</h2>
<p>Nishant has been in a dilemma since the time he
met one of his old friends. While discussing various aspects, they had a
conversation regarding the various insurance policies that are available
in the market. During the discussion, Nishant found out that his friend
also had the same term insurance plan from ABC Company that he had
bought 2 years ago. He is now 35 years old. His friend had purchased the
policy about 10 years ago when he had joined his first job. He was 25
years old then. Nishant was surprised to find out that his friend was
paying only Rs 3000 per month as the premium, while for the same policy,
he was paying Rs 7,000. Nishant couldn&rsquo;t understand why there was a
difference in the premium amount of the same plan by the same company.
He had always looked at premiums as the cost of insurance plans. Has
inflation resulted in change in premium of the plan in 8 years? Also can
companies charge two different people two different premiums? On what
basis does the company calculate the premium? These were some questions
in Nishant&rsquo;s mind. This chapter aims to clear all doubts about premium:
its types and the factors that go into its calculation.</p>
<h2 id="1-understand-the-concept-of-premium-learning-outcome-a">1. Understand the concept of premium. [Learning Outcome a]</h2>
<p>What is premium? Before addressing Nishant&rsquo;s dilemma about premium, let us first
a few things about an insurance plan. When an individual purchases an
insurance plan, following things happen: A contract is signed between
the proposer and the insurance company. In the contract the insurance
company generally agrees to make a payment of sum assured along with
bonuses, ( if applicable ) to the nominees, in case something happens to
the insured or to pay the same to the policyholder, if he survives the
specified term, if the client pays the appropriate premium within the
stipulated time.. The benefits payable differ from one product to
another. For the same, the insured (or proposer) agrees to pay a
consideration (premium/s) to the insurance company as specified in the
contract.</p>
<p>Diagram 1: Insurance contract in which insurer provides risk cover for a
consideration (premium)</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/PREMIUMS_AND_BONUSES_21.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>From the above we can conclude that premium refers to the amount
(consideration) that the insured has to pay to the insurance company
periodically for the insurance cover purchased. Premium can also be paid
in a lump sum amount as a single premium. An insurance company has
mainly two source of income. (a) The first is premium amount collected
from policyholders and (b) through the returns on investments made by
the company. The funds for investment come from the premium collected.
Hence the main source of income for the insurance company is the
premium. In this respect an insurance company has to calculate the
premium amount very carefully. The premium should be sufficient enough
to meet all the expenses of the company. The expenses include the
payment that needs to be made in case of claims made by the insured (sum
assured), administrative expenses and other infrastructure costs.
Basically the premium depends upon the sum assured and the type of
insurance plan taken. Premiums can also be referred to as the cost of
the insurance plan that is purchased by the individual.</p>
<p>Before moving further, let us first understand some of the important
terms related to premiums that will be used in this chapter.
Important terms defined:
Sum assured: the insurance company signs a contract with
the insured, where it promises to pay a certain amount to the
beneficiaries of the policyholders in case the policyholder (insured)
dies during the term of the policy or to the policyholder himself, if he
survives the term of the policy. The amount is paid to the beneficiaries
is also known as death benefit. This sum assured is the amount
predetermined by the individual, based on his future liabilities and
current income.
Lapsed policy: a default in the payment of premium can
result in the cancellation of the policy. This is known as a lapsed
policy. A certain grace period is provided by insurance companies to
make the payment, if the policyholder fails to make the payment during
this period the policy is considered to be lapsed.
Age of the policyholder: the correct age of the policyholder needs to be determined
for calculating the premium. The general rule is &ldquo;higher the age, higher
will be the premium&rdquo;. Age of the policyholder on the date of the
commencement of the policy needs to be calculated by insurance
companies. For calculating age by and large insurance companies consider
only the number of years completed and ignores months and days. There
are three methods using which the age of the policyholder can be
determined:
Age next birthday: life insurance companies calculate
premiums based on the age that an individual will achieve on his next
birthday. In other words the age as on the birthday coming after the
commencement of policy.</p>
<p>Scenario 1 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance plan. Age
will be</p>
<p>4th July 1982 4th Dec 2010</p>
<p>29 years</p>
<p>Scenario 2 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance plan. Age
will be</p>
<p>10 Oct 1976 th 11 Aug 2010 34 years</p>
<p>Age last birthday: this method is also known as actual age method. In
this method insurance companies calculate age based on the last
birthday. In other words the age is taken as on the birthday coming
before the commencement of policy.</p>
<p>Scenario 1 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance plan. Age
will be</p>
<p>th</p>
<p>4 July 1982 th 4 Dec 2010 28 years</p>
<p>Scenario 2 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance plan. Age
will be</p>
<p>10 Oct 1976 th 11 Aug 2010 33 years</p>
<p>Age nearest (nearer) birthday: In this method insurance companies
calculate the age based on the nearest birthday, which could be either
the last birthday or next birthday. In other words the age is taken as
on the birthday within 6 months before or after the date of commencement
of policy.</p>
<p>Scenario 1 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance plan. Age

<p>10 Oct 1976 th 11 Aug 2010 34 years</p>
<p>Mortality table: mortality tables are also known as life tables or
actuarial tables. Mortality tables are used by insurance companies for
calculating premiums for insurance products. The mortality table
contains the mortality rate for each age. The mortality experience for
each plan is different. Mortality table is prepared by actuaries on the
basis of past experiences. A mortality rate is the probability that a
person will die within the next one year. Based on this, insurance
companies can calculate the probability that a person would survive a
certain age. This mortality rates are based on the past data. Mortality
studies reflecting the experience of Indians are made by the Mortality
and Morbidity Investigation Bureau (MMIB) set up jointly by the Life
Insurance Council and the Actuarial Society of India, to help insurers.
Actuaries: Actuaries are trained professionals who deal with the
financial aspect of risk to life. They are people qualified from the
Institute of Actuaries London or Actuarial Society of India. They
analyse the occurrence of risk and their impact, by using various
mathematical, statistical and financial models. Actuaries study
probability and analyse the whole operation of insurance business.</p>
<h2 id="duties-of-actuaries">Duties of actuaries</h2>
<p>Listed below are the duties of an actuary:
They have the legal duty to protect the benefits promised by insurance companies.
They provide actuarial advice on the insurance companies. They analyse
the trends in mortality rate of the policyholders. They analyse the past
trend of the company&rsquo;s expenses incurred and the revenues generated.
They provide technical expertise in designing insurance products. They
help in financial analysis while deciding on the pricing of products.
The prepare mortality tables which are used as basis for product
development and valuation studies They help in the construction of the
premiums. They define and evaluate the standards to assess risk. They
evaluate the solvency of the insurance company. They provide advice to
the insurance company in the investment related decisions. They help in
ascertaining the profits that need to be distributed to the
policyholders. They are responsible of valuation of insurance companies.
They ensure compliance with law.</p>
<p>Actuarial Valuation: This valuation refers to the evaluation of the
entire gamut of financial operations of an insurance company. It is done
to check the validity of assumptions made, to ensure that the business
is on sound lines. It involves analysis of income generated (or expected
to be generated) from premiums and investments. The income is compared
with the expected liabilities or expenses of the company. This is done
to evaluate the overall solvency of the business. In a valuation, the
actuary estimates the liability of the insurer in respect of the
business in the books. He then estimates the amount of premiums that are
due to be received in future, as these will add to the funds to meet the
liability. The difference between the two is the fund that the insurer
must have, to remain solvent. This is compared with the actual existing
life fund. If the present life fund is more, the insurer is solvent. The
excess in the life fund is called &lsquo;surplus&rsquo;. This is also called
&lsquo;valuation surplus&rsquo; or &lsquo;actuarial surplus&rsquo;. If the fund is less, the
insurer is not solvent. The difference is called a &lsquo;deficit&rsquo;. The method
of estimating the liability of the business and of the future premiums
is very technical and complex, involving actuarial principles. It has to
be done by an actuary with professional qualifications.</p>
<p>Question 1
If the company follows the actual age method for determining
the age of an individual, then in this case the company will calculate
the: Age next birthday Age last birthday Age nearest birthday Age on the
day of commencement of policy</p>

<p>Types of premium:</p>
<p>Diagram 2: Premiums can be classified into following types:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Premiums_and_Bonuse_22.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Risk Premium The business of insurance is based on the probabilities of
risk. Risk premium is calculated on the basis of a probability that a
person of a certain age is likely to die before his next birthday. This
expectation is calculated by actuaries based on the past experience
which is presented in a mortality table. Let us have a look at the case
of an insurance Company XYZ</p>
<p>Details for Company XYZ</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<p>The insurance company has 1000 policyholders whose age is 50 years and
each policy is issued for a sum assured of 50,000/-</p>
<p>All of them are healthy at the commencement of policy. 10 persons out of
1000 ( 1000 x 0.01) Total claim</p>
<p>Probability that a 50 year old person would die before his next birthday
is 1% Total claims made to the company in case of death of 10
policyholders (probability of 1%)</p>
<p>Rs 50,000 X 10 = Rs 5,00,000</p>
<p>Premium collected from 1000 policyholders will be</p>
<p>Total funds received by the company will be</p>
<p>Rs 500 each</p>
<p>1000 X Rs 500 = Rs 5,00,000</p>
<p>would be of Rs 5,00,000 This is risk premium that will be paid by the
policyholder Total collected premium will be Rs 5,00,000. This amount
will be sufficient to settle the claim.</p>
<h2 id="a-net-or-pure-premium">A) Net or pure premium</h2>
<p>The premiums collected by insurance companies
every year are not all used up for payment of claims for various
reasons. The real experience may be different from the probabilities
indicated by the mortality tables. Also the portion of the premium is
meant to meet survival benefits and must be kept aside. The balance
premium kept aside, after outgoes of various kinds, will be invested and
will earn some interest. To the extent of these interest earnings, the
premium charged can be reduced. The premium worked out after taking into
account the interest likely to be earned is called &ldquo;net premium or pure
premium.&rdquo; Investment earnings: the premium received by the insurance
company from policyholders is invested in various funds and securities.
The insurance company calculates the expected return on investments of
premium amount, based on past trends and also regulatory mandates (if
any). If the interest earnings are expected to be high, then the premium
amount can be reduced.</p>
<p>Based on the expected returns on investment, the net premium is
calculated. Loading is the part of a premium that includes various
expenses incurred by the insurance company. Loadings are the extra
charges that are added to the premium by the insurance companies.</p>
<h2 id="b-level-premium">B) Level premium</h2>
<p>In level premium, the premium amount is fixed for the
entire period of the policy term. If the total policy term is for 20
years, then, the same premium amount is fixed for the entire term of the
policy. Level premiums are charged by insurance companies for two main
reasons: In the later years of his life the risk profile of an investor
increases substantially and so does the risk premium. As the cost of
risk to life will be high in the later years; this could make premium
payment very challenging and could trigger defaults in payment of
premium. as he would not be able to afford such a high premium . Also,
the insurance company would find it difficult to administer annual
changes in the premium, once the contract is signed. Hence the insurance
company spreads the risk premium towards the whole time period of the
policy (also called as premium paying period) and charges &ldquo;level&rdquo;
premium.</p>
<p>The insurance company sets aside a certain sum of money received from
the premium in the initial years to a separate account to help them meet
the higher risk expenses for the later parts of the term of the policy,
when the available premium will be less than what would be needed to
cover the expenses at that point of time.</p>
<h2 id="adverse-selection">Adverse selection:</h2>
<p>If a high premium amount is charged in later years, then it could result in most
of the healthy people quitting the plan at that point of time, as they
would feel that they do not require the insurance plan. People, who
suffer from various diseases, would be ready to continue the plan to
receive the benefit available with the plan. They will be ready to pay
the high premium. This would lead to adverse selection i.e. proportion
of unhealthy people in the portfolio would be more as compared to
healthy people. This would adversely affect the calculations of the
insurance company based on mortality tables. Office premium The major
expenses of an Insurance Company incurs is commission, salaries to
employees, in addition to other expenses like rent, electricity and
other administration expenses. These are known as office expenses.</p>
<h2 id="extra-premium">The level premium figure arrived at after loading the net premium or
pure premium is called the office premium. They are now ready for use.
The premium figures printed in the promotional literature and brochures
are office premium. They are also referred to as the &ldquo;Tabular premium&rdquo;.
The risk (of death) is more in a policy with a longer term than in a
policy with a shorter term. But because of the practice of level
premium, the tabular premium charged (per annum), would be less for a
longer term policy than for a shorter term policy. On the aggregate, the
total premium over the entire term would be higher in the longer term
plan than in the shorter term plan. If the mode is yearly, the
probability of default in the subsequent renewal premium to complete the
year, does not arise. The insurer can utilize this amount for the entire
year and earn more interest than if the premiums were paid in
instalment. Therefore, the premium rates would have to be slightly
increased or decreased depending on the chosen mode of payment. Some
insurers provide increases or additional amounts in premium for
quarterly or monthly modes, but no adjustments for yearly modes. This
depends on how the insurer concerned has worked out the office premiums.
Similarly there may be adjustments to be made depending on the Sum
Assured (S.A.) .If the policy is for a small SA, the administrative
costs would, as a proportion of premium, be more than if the policy is
of a large SA, because many expenses like clerical costs, printing of
policies, accounting overheads etc. are constant, and do not vary
according to the SA of the policy. Depending on the manner of the
loadings made, insurers will provide rebates for higher SA or extra for
small SA.
Extra premium</h2>
<p>Extra premiums may be charged on a particular
policy. This may happen because of the grant of some benefit in addition
to the basic benefits under the plan like accident benefit or premium
waiver benefit. Extra premium may become chargeable because of decisions
relating to the extent of extra risk in any particular case, if the risk
of the person to be insurer is assessed as more than normal because of
health or because of occupation, residence or personal habits, insurers
may charge extra premiums.</p>
<h2 id="premium-loading">Premium Loading</h2>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Premiums_and_Bonuse_23.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Some of the reasons for which insurers load net or pure premiums are:
a. Administrative expenses: these include the administrative, investment
management, infrastructural expenses etc. Contingency charges: the
expenses that are expected to arise in case of unexpected contingencies
that can result in sudden increase in the mortality rate. The premium
payments are calculated on the basis of the mortality rates in the
mortality table, which are determined for normal circumstances. In case
some natural disasters like tsunami, earthquakes etc. occur, where large
number of deaths take place, the number of deaths can be more than the
expected (assumed) number of deaths while pricing. In this case, the
insurance companies would have to pay much larger amount of money as
insurance claims than the amount that was originally estimated or
assumed. In such events, the solvency of the company could get impacted
adversely. To avoid this situation, companies load the charges for
meeting these contingencies through additional amounts being factored in
the premium amount. Bonus: will be paid to the with-profit
policyholders. The policyholders that are entitled to the bonus have to
pay some additional premium amount. Some of the factors that need to be
considered for gross premium are as follows: a. The policy term: the
gross premium for long term insurance plans would be high as compared to
the short term insurance plans. In case the term of the policy is for a
long period of 20 years, then in this case the risk on life would be
high as compared to a policy for a short term of 5 years. In other words
the probability that a person would die in next 5 years would be low as
compared to the probability that the person would die in next 20 years.</p>
<p>b. Periodicity of the premium payment: (1) Insurance companies offer
different modes/frequencies at which premiums can be paid (yearly/half
yearly/quarterly/ monthly (2) Insurance companies prefer the annual mode
of premium payment as the administrative charges and risk of default of
payment by the policy holder in this mode is low as compared to that of
monthly mode premium payment. The benefit of annual mode is that the
company gets a lump sum amount for the investment as compared to the
monthly mode of payment where the amount available for investment would
be less and received over 12 small monthly instalments. The risk of
default in payment of premium under monthly mode is high. Some companies
prefer the annual premium payment. Accordingly the companies provide a
rebate on the annual mode of premium payment as it is received in one
lump sum during the beginning of the policy year. Reasons why Annual
mode of premium payment is preferred Annual premium payment Monthly

[Learning Outcome c]</h2>
<p>Premium calculation Insurance premium for each
individual differs and is based on several factors. Some of these
factors are as follows: The age of the person to be insured: if the age
of the person is high, then premium will also be high to cover the cost
of risk on his life. Medical condition: an individual suffering from
some disease may be charged a higher premium as compared to a healthy
individual depending on the nature of medical impairment etc. Sum
Assured: premiums also depend on the sum assured of the insurance
policy. Higher the sum assured, higher will be the premium. Type of
insurance plan: premium also depends upon the type of insurance plan.
The insurance company will charge higher premium on &ldquo;with &ndash; profit&rdquo;
(bonus) insurance plans&rsquo; as compared to &lsquo;without profit / without- bonus
insurance plans&rsquo;. Mortality table: mortality tables determine the risk
associated based on several factors, based on which the premiums are
determined by the actuaries. The interest amount: the rate of interest
at which the company will offer guaranteed benefits, will increase or
decrease the premium.</p>
<p>Diagram 4: Factors that are considered in calculation of premium</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Premiums_and_Bonuse_24.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>If you remember the scenario that we discussed in the very beginning of
the chapter, Nishant was concerned about the difference in the premiums
paid by him and his friend.</p>
<p>From the above discussion, it is clear that one of the primary reasons
for the difference in premium is age at which the policy is purchased.
Nishant&rsquo;s friend had taken the policy, when he was 23 years of age).
Hence the premium for him is lesser, for the same sum assured as
compared to Nishant who is of the same age. Nishant purchased the policy
when he was 32 years old; hence he paid a higher premium. Apart from
age, the other factor that could impact the premium could be his medical
conditions, his occupation etc. at the time of commencement of risk.</p>
<p>Steps in premium calculation Steps</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>1. Find out the office premium for a given age based on the required
insurance plan and term of the plan. The given age could be either of
the following Age next birthday Age last birthday Age nearer birthday
The premium mentioned is per thousand sum assured.</p>
<p>Tabular premium of ABC insurance company for the given age (age next
birthday) of the policyholder for a term insurance plan is Rs. 32.50 per
thousand sum assured.</p>
<p>2. If the insurer provides rebates on the sum assured, then deduct
these from the sum assured. This is known as adjustments on rebate</p>
<p>The following rebates per thousand SA are offered by ABC insurance
company on the sum assured Rs 20,000/- - 49,999/-</p>
<p>Re 1</p>
<p>Rs 50,000/- - 99,999 /-</p>
<p>Rs 1.50</p>
<p>Rs1,00,000 /- &ndash; and above</p>
<p>Rs 2</p>
<p>If the sum assured for the policyholder is Rs 60,000, then the premium
will be Rs 31 (i.e., 32.50 -1.50) 3. If the insurance company offers
rebate on the mode of payment of premium, then further deductions for
the same are made</p>
<p>The company offers rebate of 1.5% on the annual mode of payment. The
policyholder has selected annual mode of premium payment. The deducted
premium will be Rs 30.54 (31 &ndash; (31 X 1.5/100 ))</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Add the extra premiums</p>
<p>The extra charges levied by the company are as follows : Benefits
payable</p>
<p>Rs 2 per thousand.</p>
<p>Administrative expenses</p>
<p>Rs 1 per thousand</p>
<p>The total addition has to be made for Rs 3, hence the total premium will
be Rs 33.54 5. Multiply the sum assured</p>
<p>the amount with</p>
<p>The sum assured is Rs 60,000 and the premium per 1000 SA is Rs 33.54.
Premium will be 33.54 X 60 = Rs 2012.4.</p>
<p>6. If the premium amount arrived at is having paisa in the final figure
, then they could be ignored could be rounded off to the next higher
integer could be rounded off to nearest 50 paisa Any one of the above
rules are followed by insurance companies,</p>
<p>The insurance company can either follow any of the following rules:
Rules</p>
<p>Premium will be</p>

<p>Rs 2012</p>
<p>could be rounded off Rs 2013 to the next higher integer could be rounded
off to nearest 50 paisa</p>
<p>Rs 2012.50</p>
<h2 id="additional-information">Additional information</h2>
<p>It is to be remembered that insurance companies
have choice over the steps to be followed for calculating premium
amount. In the above calculation, the deductions for the rebate on mode
of payment are done after the deductions for the rebate on sum assured.
Insurance companies have the choice to first deduct the rebate on mode
of payment and then further deduct the rebate on sum assured. In the
above example Office premium Rebate on mode of payment Premium after
deductions on sum assured Rebate on sum assured Premium after deductions
on sum assured Premium amount</p>
<p>32.50 1.5 % on annual payment of premium 32.50 - (32.50 X1.5/100) =
32.02 Rs 1.50 32.02- 1.50 = 30.52 Rs 1831</p>
<p>The above calculation has been done for the annual mode of premium
payment. If the premium payment option selected is half yearly,
quarterly or monthly then the premium amount will be different as the
rebate offered for annual payment is higher and rebate reduces in case
of half yearly, quarterly or monthly modes resulting in an increase in
the premium.</p>
<p>Question 3 The premium charged by an insurance company depends on ______________ Age of the person
Type of insurance plan
Participation in bonus
All of the above</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-d">4. Understand the concept of bonus.
[Learning Outcome d]</h2>
<p>Bonus
The distribution of valuation of surplus to policyholders is done through
the declaration of bonus&quot;</p>
<p>Bonus is the benefit in addition to the sum assured that is distributed
to&quot; with profit&quot; or &ldquo;participatory&rdquo; policyholders. Only the
policyholders &ndash; holding &ldquo;with-profit&rdquo; policy are entitled to a share in
the bonus.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-bonus">Types of bonus:</h2>
<p>Simple reversionary bonus: in this method the
bonus is generally indicated as a percentage of the basic sum assured
under the policy added to the sum assured. Such addition of bonus to sum
assured is called vesting. The simple reversionary bonus is calculated
as below: Sum assured Bonus declared Total amount that will be paid to
policyholder will be (sum assured + Bonus)</p>
<p>Rs 60,000 Rs 3000.00 (@ Rs 50 per thousand or 5% of sum assured ) Rs
63000</p>
<p>Simple reversionary bonus is declared generally annually and remains
attached to the policy but is payable on maturity of the policy or prior
death of the policyholder. Once declared it cannot be withdrawn and is
payable on maturity or on the death of the insured. If the bonus
declared in the subsequent year is 6% (Rs.60 per thousand) then the
bonus for that year will be Rs. 3600 in the above example. This will get
added to the sum assured and the total sum assured at the end of the
year will become Rs. 66,600 (original sum assured Rs. 60,000 + first
year bonus Rs. 3000 + second year bonus Rs. 3600) Compound reversionary
bonus: in this method the bonus is calculated on compound interest
basis. Compound reversionary bonus is added to the existing SA including
vested bonuses. (In the above example, if a 5% compound reversionary
bonus is declared in the subsequent year, the next SA will be Rs 66150
(63000 + (63000 x 5/100)) Terminal bonus: This is a one-time bonus
provided for long term policies, on attaining maturity or death of the
insured person, so long as the policy has continued for a specified
period.. The bonus paid, depends on the profits made by the insurance
company. Terminal bonus is the sum added to the policy at the time of
its maturity. Terminal bonus is assigned to the policy only when the
policy reaches its eligibility period, and which may differ from one
insurance company to another. This works like an incentive, encouraging
the policy holder to continue keeping their policies in force.</p>
<h2 id="interim-bonus">Interim bonus:</h2>
<p>Interim bonus is payable to policy holders who become
claimants between two st</p>
<p>valuation dates. Bonus is declared after valuation as on 31 March every
year. st Only the policies, which were in force on 31 March, would be
included for st providing bonus. The policies that commenced after 31
March would not be able to get benefits till the next valuation date.
Hence, Interim bonus is declared for these policyholders, to make
payment to the policies that get concluded between two valuations.</p>
<p>Question 4 What is the type of bonus which is payable to policyholders
who become claimants between two valuation dates? Terminal bonus Interim
bonus Simple reversionary bonus Compound reversionary bonus</p>
<p>Summary Premium refers to the specific amount that the insured has to
pay to the insurance company periodically as per the policy terms. A
default in premium payment can result in the policy lapsing. The
mortality table contains mortality rate for each age and gender, which
is used for calculating the premium. A mortality rate is the probability
that a person will die before his next birthday Actuaries are
professionals who also deal with the financial aspects of risk to life.
They analyse the occurrence of risk and their impact by using various
mathematical, statistical and financial models along with many other
functions. Premiums and income earned from investments by insurance
companies are maintained in a fund known as life fund. Loading is a part
of the premium that includes various expenses incurred by the insurance
company to manage operations of the business. In level premium, the
premium remains fixed for the entire term of the policy.</p>
<p>The premium charged by insurance companies is different for each
individual and premium calculations are based on many factors : age of
the individual, his/her medical condition, sum assured, morality rate,
type of insurance plan and several other factors which differ from
person to person like his family history, social habits ,occupation
etc.. Bonus is the benefit in addition to sum assured that is
distributed to &lsquo;with profit&rsquo; policyholders. Interim bonus is payable
under policies where a final payment is payable between two valuation
dates.</p>
