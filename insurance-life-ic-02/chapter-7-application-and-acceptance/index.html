<h2 id="application-and-acceptance">APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter aims to provide you with an understanding of the processes involved for both the
proposer and the insurer when applying for a life insurance policy and
its acceptance. It explains the importance of utmost good faith for
insurance contracts, the essentials of an insurance contract and
insurable interest. It also aims to provide an understanding of the
importance of the role of underwriting and the process insurers use to
assess risk and underwrite a proposal.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Understand the fundamentals of a life insurance contract. Understand the

policies are underwritten.</p>
<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this scenario</h2>
<p>The life insurance business in India is growing at
a rapid pace. More people are taking out life insurance and this growth
puts more emphasis on the application and acceptance process for life
insurance. Growth without adequate underwriting will place pressure on
insurers to pay claims for policies which they may not have accepted
initially and which can have serious consequences for the solvency of an
insurer. It is essential that during a period of growth that
underwriting processes and standards are maintained to ensure risk is
accurately assessed and correct premium is charged for the risk being
accepted by the insurer.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-a">Understand the fundamentals of a life insurance contract.
[Learning Outcome a]</h2>
<p>A life insurance policy is a contract between the insurer
and the insured. This creates obligations as well as rights on both
parties to the contract.</p>
<p>Diagram 1: Essential elements of a valid contract</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Application_and_Acceptance_71.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>The essential requirements for a valid contract are: capacity of parties
to contract free consent offer and acceptance lawful consideration
legality of object consensus ad idem meaning the parties to the contract
must be of the same mind regarding the subject matter of the contract
capability of being performed Insurance is a specialised contract. Apart
from the usual essential requirements of a contract, insurance contracts
are subject to two additional principles. These are: the principle of
utmost good faith the principle of insurable interest These 2 additional
principles apply to both life and non-life insurance. 1.1 Principle of
Utmost Good Faith Commercial contracts are usually subject to the
principle of caveat emptor &ndash; let the buyer beware. This principle does
not apply to insurance contracts as most of the facts relating to
health, habits, personal history, family history that form the basis of
a life insurance contract are known only to the proposer. Unless
disclosed by the proposer, they cannot be known to the insurer.
Non-disclosure of these facts puts the insurer and the community of
policyholders at a disadvantage causing &lsquo;adverse selection&rsquo;. If there is
non-disclosure there is &lsquo;consensus ad idem&rsquo; in the contract and it
becomes an unfair contract. It can be held to be void ab initio (from
the beginning or start). In life insurance the duty of disclosure
operates until the risk commences. Circumstances which may have arisen
after the contract has commenced do not affect the validity of the
contract unless the conditions of the contract make relevant
stipulations to that effect. There would also be a duty of disclosure in
the following situations as a new contract is being entered into: the
terms of the policy are to be altered a lapsed policy is being revived a
surrendered policy is being reinstated</p>
<p>The declaration made by the proposer in a proposal for life insurance
turns the representations into warranties. If there are
misrepresentations, the insurer is entitled to treat the contract as
null and void and forfeit all monies paid. Section 45 of the Insurance
Act 1938 limits the insurers right to cancel the contract by stipulating
that a policy cannot be called into question after 2 years, on the
grounds of inaccurate or false statement unless it is proved to be
material and made with fraudulent intent. The duty of full disclosure
applies equally to both the proposer and the insurer. It is easier to
see where the proposer may be in breach of the duty rather than the
insurer. In practice, there could be breaches of the duty on the part if
the insurer or the agent making representations on behalf of the
insurer. Examples of where these breaches may occur are: making untrue
statements during the sale not advising the proposer to disclose all
material facts not advising the proposer that loans may not be available
under the plan offered or that bonus rates could be different
withholding information that conditions such as being a non-smoker, are
relevant to grant a reduced premium promises are made about the bonuses
and returns</p>
<h2 id="12-insurable-interest">1.2 Insurable Interest</h2>
<p>To understand insurable interest, consider the
following situation:</p>
<p>Ramesh is a 35 year old man working with a private company. Ramesh&rsquo;s
family includes his wife, a five year old son and dependent parents.
They have their own house. Consider the following situations: Situation
1: Ramesh fears falling sick and is not able to report to work for a few
days due to ill health in future? Situation 2: Ramesh fears meeting with
an accident and dying prematurely?</p>
<p>Let us try to understand all the above situations carefully. In
situation one, it is in Ramesh&rsquo;s interest to keep himself fit because if
he falls sick then he will not be able to report to work, which will
lead to loss of pay. To safeguard him from unexpected illnesses and the
resultant loss of pay, Ramesh can take medical / health insurance. In
situation two, in case Ramesh&rsquo;s untimely death, the family will suffer
financial losses. Ramesh has responsibilities such as taking care of his
family, planning for his son&rsquo;s education, planning for his son&rsquo;s
marriage, planning for retirement etc. Ramesh&rsquo;s family depends upon him
to take care of all these goals. Ramesh can take life insurance cover to
make sure that his family does not suffer in his absence. In both the
above situations, if any of the events happen (Ramesh falls sick, Ramesh
meets with an accident), it will affect Ramesh&rsquo;s financial position
adversely. If none of the events happen and everything continues
normally, then Ramesh stands to gain and enjoy the continued benefits
from his property, his family&rsquo;s good health and his own.</p>
<h2 id="concept-of-insurable-interest">Concept of insurable interest</h2>
<p>What makes an insurance contract a legal
contract is that insured must have an insurable interest in the subject
matter of insurance. The insured must be in a relationship with the
subject matter of insurance because what is being insured is a financial
or pecuniary interest in the subject matter of the insurance, whereby
they benefit from the safety and well-being of the subject matter of
insurance and would be prejudiced by its loss or damage. From the above
explanation and the four situations, we can say that Ramesh has an
&lsquo;insurable interest&rsquo; in his own well-being, his life, his property and
his father&rsquo;s health in a way that the continued well-being (safety) of
all four would benefit Ramesh, and if something goes wrong with any of
them, it would affect Ramesh financially and he would suffer a loss. The
Insurance Act 1938 does not define insurable interest. The circumstances
under which insurable interest is deemed to exist have been clarified by
court judgments. It has been held that a person has unlimited insurable
interest in their own life.</p>
<p>Other clarifications that are relevant for life insurance are: a husband
has insurable interest in the life of the wife and vice versa an
employer has insurable interest in their employee to the extent of the
value of their services an employee has insurable interest in their
employer to the extent of their remuneration for the period of notice a
creditor has insurable interest in the life of the debtor, to the extent
of the debt partners have insurable interest in the lives of each other
to the extent of the respective financial stakes a surety has insurable
interest in the life of their co-surety to the extent of the debt and
also on the life of the principal debtor a company has insurable
interest in the life of a key valuable employee (keyman) If members of a
family are in business together or there are other financial
relationships, insurable interest arises out of the financial
involvement and the business ties, not the family ties. It is presumed
that parents have an insurable interest in the life of a child, for as
long as he/she is a child. The insurable interest ceases when the child
becomes a major. For this reason, policies on the lives of children
incorporate a clause, where the policy vests in the child on their
attainment of majority.</p>
<p>Kiran and Sachin are brothers who have recently started a business
together. Both have used all their savings to start the business
together and are working hard to build the business. Neither brother has
a life insurance policy and now want to take out policies so that in the
event anything happens to either of them the other will not be
disadvantaged. Because they have started a business together the
brothers now have an insurable interest in each others lives and are
able to take out life insurance for each other.</p>

<p>Question 1 In life insurance how long does the duty of diclosure operate
? Until the proposal for insurance is signed by the propser Until the
risk commences For the duration of the policy Until the first renewal</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-b">Understand the life insurance application process.
[Learning Outcome b]</h2>
<p>Imagine that you are an insurance agent and a prospect approaches
you for procuring life insurance. He has never bought a life insurance
policy earlier and needs your advice. You need to explain to him the
steps involved in determining the type of life policy that best suits
his needs and the process involved in applying for the insurance
,including completing the proposal form, personal statement and having a
medical examination if required.</p>
<h2 id="21-prospectus">2.1 Prospectus</h2>
<p>A life insurance contract is issued based on an
application, called a proposal which is made by the person who wants
insurance. This person is known as the proposer. The proposer may not be
the person to be insured, as in the case of parents proposing to insure
their minor children. The insurer considers and accepts the proposal.
The application and the documentation have to satisfy the requirements
of a valid contract. The Companies Act 1956 requires public companies
entering the capital market for funds, offering shares or debentures or
through deposits to issue a prospectus giving therein complete details
of the: the business they are in their set up the various products and
services they offer statements showing their financial position The
prospectus may be called an &lsquo;offer at large&rsquo; as it is an offer to the
public to come forward and invest in the company. The prospectus is
expected to give enough information to the prospective investor so they
can make a decision regarding whether the investment is worthwhile or
not. A prospectus issued by a life insurance company is simpler. It
generally gives details regarding the setup of the company, the
insurance plans they offer and general terms and conditions. Due to the
nature of life insurance business, an insurer&rsquo;s prospectus will never be
adequate for a prospect to make a decision on the plan or the terms of
the life insurance policy that will best suit them. In terms of the IRDA
regulations the prospectus some of the details are listed below: the
various insurance plans offered the terms and conditions whether the
policy is &ldquo;participating&rdquo; (with bonus) or &ldquo;non-participating&rdquo; (without
bonus) the riders available along with that policy and the scope of the
riders</p>
<h2 id="22-proposal-form-and-related-documents">A prospectus does not have to be a single book with details of all the
plans offered. Some insurers print separate pages for each plan
detailing the benefits and obligations and also the terms and conditions
of the particular policy. Public opinion in certain countries is of the
view that life insurance companies should also conform to the
requirements of investment companies that solicit public funds for
investment in shares, debentures and deposits. This is due in part
because the boundaries in financial services are becoming blurred as
linked life insurance plans are offered as part risk cover and part
investment
2.2 Proposal form and related documents</h2>
<p>The proposal form is
the application form for the insurance. These are printed by insurance
companies and are made available to prospects through agents and in some
cases insurance companies have the proposal form on the internet. The
person requesting the insurance is called the proposer and they must
complete and sign the form themselves. If someone other than the
proposer has completed the form they must delcare the answers are as
dictated by the proposer. If the signature is not in the same as the
language the proposal form is printed, someone must declare and sign
that they have explained the content of the questions to the proposer
and the answers had been recorded after that. The signature of the
proposer must be witnessed. If the proposer is illiterate, they have to
affix an impression of their left thumb instead of a signature and this
has to be attested by a third party. These procedures are essential to
make the proposer accountable for their statements in the proposal form
and to make the proposal form part of an enforceable contract. The
proposal has two functions, it is a request for insurance and it is also
an offer to enter into a contract. In it the proposer provides the
following information: information about himself (name, date of birth,
address, occupation) name and other particulars, including family
history (family members, their ages, health conditions) of the person to
be insured amount of insurance cover plan and term preferred mode of
premium opted for details of nominee</p>
<p>The completed proposal form is given to the insurer along with: the
personal statement of health which contains information regarding past
sicknesses and hospitalisations and the habits of the person to be
insured which is completed by the life to be insured,and the proposer
,if the life to be insured is a minor. the confidential report of the
agent. If a medical examination is required the personal statement is
given to the medical examiner who will send it to the insurer with their
report on the medical examination. The agents confidential report is
important for the insurer to be able to assess the risk and
acceptability of the proposal for insurance. The report contains
information regarding the proposer&rsquo;s financial position and lifestyle.
The purpose of the report is to provide additional information to the
underwriter for assessing the risk, particularly in relation to moral
hazard if it exists. Occassionally if the proposal is for a large amount
or the person to be insured is of advanced age and does not have any
life insurance to date or for other reasons the insurer may request a
report from another senior official. The propsal form together with the
personal statement are important documents for the following reasons:
they contain valuable information about the proposer and the person to
be insured the statements in the proposal and personal statement
constitute the basis of the contract The proposer declares at the end of
the proposal form that the answers and statements given by them are true
and complete. If any statement is shown to be untrue the contract will
become null and void ab initio. The importance of this has been
discussed earlier in this chapter while dealing with Utmost Good Faith.
If the proposal is completed in a language not familiar to the proposer
or the proposer is illiterate (and can only affix an impression of their
thumb imprint instead of a signature) someone familiar with the language
must declare that they have explained the contents to the proposer and
the proposer has understood. This person is then bound by the
declaration in the proposal and the consequences of a false declaration.
This would be a requirement in countries like India where there are many
spoken languages other than the business language of the insurer and
also because of the low literacy levels.</p>
<p>It is understood and explicitly stated in the policy that the proposal
and its contents form the basis of the insurance contract evidenced by
the policy. Some companies attach the proposal to the policy as part of
it. The IRDA regulations require a copy of the proposal be given to the
policyholder with the policy. Because the proposal is the basis for the
contract it has extensive questions related to health, habits and family
history of the life insured and makes it a lengthy document.</p>
<h2 id="23-medical-examinations">2.3 Medical examinations</h2>
<p>Normally the person proposed to be insured is
subject to a medical examination to determine the state of their health.
The age of the person to be insured and the proposed sum assured
determines the extent of the medical examination. As age and sum assured
increase, so does the rigour of the medical examination. Increasing
rigour results in more specialised testing such as radiology, , cardiac
tests like ECG or TMT, Blood tests etc. Insurers will usually authorise
the medical examiners who can complete the medical examinations and
apply limits for them. In remote areas only Government doctors may be
available for these purposes. Senior doctors are authorised to examine
for large sum assureds and those which require special tests for some
reason. A policy of waiving the requirement of medical examinations for
people who satisfy certain conditions has been adopted by insurers over
a period of time. Gradually with favourable claim experience and
increase in the base of the insured population these conditions have
been relaxed. A large number of cases are considered without medical
examination, these are called non-medical insurances. The practice of
underwriting cases without a medical examination has been adopted by
almost all the insurers.The amounts for which the coverss would be made
available on non-medical basis varies from one insurer to another ,and
also from one product to another within an insurance company.
Non-medical insurance schemes result in: the simplification and
hastening of the process of assessing risk reduced inconvenience for the
parties concerned cost savings for the insurer as medical fees are not
paid.</p>
<p>The elimination of medical examinations has not resulted in the lowering
of the standard of selection. Non-medical insurance requires a more
detailed proposal form to be completed and a more detailed report from
the agent and other officials. The risk is assessed based on the
statements in the proposal and personal history forms and on the agents
confidential report. The insurer is still entitled to request a medical
examination in a case that normally qualifies for consideration under
the non-medical scheme, based on the personal details on the Proposal
form, Agent&rsquo;s report and the medical history of the life to be assured.
Employees working in Government offices, Quasi-Government offices such
as Municiplaities, District boards, Local boards etc., state
corporations, Government industrial undertakings and reputed
institutions such as private colleges and schools which normally insist
on medical examinations prior to recruitment, provide good working
environments, pay fair remuneration and maintain leave records are able
to use the non-medical scheme. The PLI (Postal Life Insurance) also has
a non-medical scheme for applicants fulfilling certain defined criteria.</p>
<h2 id="24-special-reports">2.4 Special Reports</h2>
<p>In addition to the proposal form, personal
statement, agents report, medical examiners report and age proof,
special medical reports may be required if: the sum assured is very high
the age at entry is on the higher side the insurance cover applied for
is under a high risk plan the normal medical examination or agent&rsquo;s
report discloses some adverse feature The underwriter has the right and
discretion to request additional information through special reports if
they consider these reports necessary for a fair assessment of the risk.
The reports may relate to things such as: medical conditions income &amp; /
occupation of the applicant habits &amp; life-style of the applicant</p>
<h2 id="25-age-proof">2.5 Age Proof</h2>
<p>As age increases so does the risk of death. The likelihood
of a person aged 70 dying in the next year is more than that of a person
aged 20. For this reason the age of the proposer plays a vital role in
assessing the risk of death and therefore the amount of premium to be
charged. Age, along with other factors such as health and habits are
considered by the underwriter. Fifty years ago age proof was not
insisted on at the time of accepting the risk. Premium was calculated
based on the age as stated on the proposal form. It was assumed that in
the majority of cases the age stated would be correct and the proof of
age could be submitted during the currency of the policy. The age had to
be proved before a claim was settled. If the age was proved higher the
arrears of the difference in premium was recovered with interest. This
practice proved to be inconvenient and caused delays. Proof of age was
not easily available, particularly for death claims. It was also found
that the policy may not have been issued had the correct age been
stated. For these reasons proof of age is required at the commencement
of the policy.</p>
<p>Some of the standard age proof/s acceptable to life insurance companies
are: certified extract from Municipal or other records made at the time
of birth certificate of baptism certified extract from school or college
records certified extract from the service register in the case of
employees of Government or quasi Government institutions and reputed
commercial and educational institutions passport within its validity
period identity cards issued by Defence department in case of defence
personnel Driving License within its validity period. any other document
where the date of birth has been proved on the basis of one of the other
standard proofs of age acceptable to insurance companies. If standard
proof is not available alternate proofs of age are subject to the
company norms laid down. They may also charge extra premium for
non-standard age-proof or restrict the terms to safeguard against the
possibility of the correct age being higher than what is stated.</p>
<p>Question 2 The life insurance proposal has 2 functions. One is a request
for insurance, what is the other one from the following options? Ensures
the proposer fulfils their duty of disclosure Ensures that the proposer
has an insurable interest in the subject matter of insurance An offer to
enter into a contract Provides information about the amount of insurance
required</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcome-c">Understand how life insurance policies are underwritten.
[Learning Outcome c]</h2>
<h2 id="31-underwriting">3.1 Underwriting</h2>
<p>The underwriting process is an important
process as it assesses the risk proposed to be insured and is the basis
of the decision to accept the offer for insurance and on what terms
insurance or decline the offer for insurance. If the risk is assessed
incorrectly the premium charged may be more than necessary or less than
necessary, both of which are unfair.</p>
<p>Imagine you are an underwriter working for a life insurance company.
What factors do you think you would assess to determine the risk of a
proposal for insurance you have received? These can include: the age of
the life insured any pre-existing illnesses or disease occupation of the
life insured family history of illness or sickness</p>
<p>In life insurance the underwriter will review all the information
disclosed on the proposal form, personal statement, the report of the
agent and officials and the medical reports to arrive at their decision.
They may also refer the case to a medical referee for an expert opinion
if they deem it to be necessary. A medical referee is a senior doctor
familiar with the implications of medical conditions on life insurance.
After reviewing the proposal papers and the medical reports the
underwriter may decide to accept the proposal, as proposed (1) at
standard rates also called as Ordinary Rates (O.R) or (2) on modified
terms. The IRDA regulations state the proposer must be advised of the
decision within 15 days. Accepting at O.R. means that the person to be
insured is a standard or normal risk and the premium can be charged as
per the standard tabular rates. If the assessment is that the person to
be insured is not a standard or normal risk the decision will be one of
the following: accept for a lesser sum assured than proposed accept for
a shorter term than proposed accept for a different plan than proposed
charge a higher premium than the standard rate impose a lien which
reduces the insurers liability under the policy for a period of time or
under certain conditions exclude certain specified risks under the
policy postpone for a specified period decline The effect of each of the
decisions above is detailed below: Decision Effect of decision Accept
for a lesser sum assured than proposed</p>
<p>Reduces the risk level of an insurance company</p>
<p>Accept for a shorter term than proposed</p>
<p>Reduces the tenure of risk The risk of someone dying within the next 5
years is less than the risk they will die in the next 10 years. The risk
in a longer term plan is more than the risk in a shorter term plan.</p>
<p>Accept for a different plan than proposed</p>
<p>Reduces the risk level for an insurance company. Modified plans can
reduce the risk. Term plans are more risky than Endowment plans which
have an element of savings.</p>

liability under the policy for a period of time or under certain
conditions</p>
<p>This decision is made when the additional risk is assessed as likely to
reduce over a certain period of time. In this case if death occurs
during the lien period the sum assured will be reduced as stated in the
lien clause.</p>
<p>Exclude certain specified This decision is made when the additional risk

<p>for a</p>
<p>specified This decision is made when the assessment is adverse at the
point of application but may improve over a period of The risk is deemed
to be too great to be accepted at any point of time</p>
<p>The factors taken into account by the underwriter when assessing the
risk are physical, financial and moral hazards.</p>
<p>Physical factors taken into account at the time of underwriting include:
Physical factors</p>
<p>Impact</p>
<p>Age</p>
<p>The probability of death and sickness increases with age. These are
written into the mortality and morbidity tables. The age factor is
looked at along with other factors such as weight and blood pressure.
Certain factors are positive indicators at younger ages and negative
indicators at older ages and vice versa. Younger persons who are
underweight need more scrutiny than older persons who are underweight.
Similarly older persons who are overweight need more caution than young
persons who are overweight.</p>
<p>Sex</p>
<p>In the mid 1950&rsquo;s insurers were very selective about insuring female
lives. Deaths related to maternity were high, particularly in remote
areas. This situation has changed considerably with health care
facilities becoming increasingly available in the country. Today
insurers treat educated females as well as working females on par with
men. Additional precautions may be taken with uneducated females..</p>
<p>Build</p>
<p>Height, weight, abdomen and chest measurements provide clues regarding
lifestyle and possible tendencies to cardiac problems and diabetes. The
actual measurements are compared with standard measurements and
judgements are made on the basis of the extent of the variations.</p>
<p>Body</p>
<p>Medical examiners observe reflexes, pulse rates, heart sounds, blood and
urine analysis, x-rays etc. And report any physical impairments such as
deformities, blindness, deafness etc.</p>
<p>Family history</p>
<p>Family history will provide information on the possibility of hereditary
diseases.</p>
<p>Occupational hazards</p>
<p>These hazards are those that are attached to the job the person does.
People working at great height or with high electric voltage equipment
are more likely than those who don&rsquo;t to be victims of accidents. Many of
the jobs at municipal and other local bodies are hazardous in the sense
that the incumbents are susceptible to serious respiratory and other
illnesses. Although these risks justify extra premium, the insurers may
decide to waive the extra premium.</p>
<p>Financial underwriting looks at the relationship between the existing
financial condition of the person to be insured and the proposed amount
of the insurance. This is to assess whether there is any suggestion of
potential for trying to gain an advantage, in which case questions
regarding the legality would arise. If the likely premium seems too high
a proportion of the income some questions may arise regarding the
purpose of the insurance and the question of moral hazard would arise.
Moral hazard cannot be assessed or measured, it is judged entirely on
circumstantial evidence such as lifestyle and reputation for integrity
etc. This is a risk for which premium cannot be calculated for. If moral
hazard is suspected the underwriter would not accept the proposal at any
cost. The proposer will be advised of the terms under which the proposal
will be accepted by the underwriter. If the proposal is accepted as O.R.
the deposit paid along with the proposal if adequate will be adjusted as
first premium and the risk will commence from that time. If the
underwriter is willing to accept on modified terms, the proposer must
agree to the modified terms before a policy is issued. Any balance of
premium wherever required, must be paid. If all the requirements are
fulfilled by the proposer, the first premium will adjusted and the risk
will commence. Until the policy document is issued the first premium
receipt is evidence of commencement of risk.</p>
<h2 id="32-underwriting-standards">3.2 Underwriting Standards</h2>
<p>Risk assessment involves looking at how a
number of individual factors may affect mortality and making a
determination of the total effect of these individual effects.
Underwriters are not actuaries or doctors and would have acquired their
skills working in the office of an insurer. Underwriting is a matter of
experience.</p>
<p>If each insurer had only one underwriter in their office all decisions
would be consistent. In large insurance companies, especially those that
are national or multinational the underwriter&rsquo;s job is done by many
different people. For this reason it is necessary to develop systems
where consistent decisions are made across all the decision points. One
method which is used insurers is to have a numerical points system
called as Numerical Rating. Variations from the standard measure
regarding important risk factors such as the extent a subject matter of
insurance is over or under weight are noted. Variations within a certain
percentage may be ignored and variations over the percentage will be
allocated points based on the significance attached to the factor. All
the points are added to arrive at the total effect of variations and
extras charged on the total. Underwriting standards are constantly
reviewed by insurers and related academicians and insurers also exchange
data on their studies. Developments in medicine are making some
illnesses such as diabetes less dangerous than they previously were. The
risk attached to smoking, drinking, diabetes, polio, tuberculosis etc
are examples of the changing attitudes of insurers to diseases.</p>
<p>Question 3 What length of time does an insurer have to advise a proposer
of their decision regarding the proposal? 5 days 7 days 10 days 15 days</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In life insurance the duty of disclosure operates until the risk
commences, unless the conditions of the policy contract make relevant
stipulations. To take out a life insurance policy on someone else&rsquo;s life
the proposer must have an insurable interest in that person, whereby
they benefit from the safety and well-being of the subject matter of
insurance and would be prejudiced by its loss or damage.</p>
<p>The proposal has two functions, it is a request for insurance and it is
also an offer to enter into a contract. In life insurance it is
understood and explicitly stated in the policy that the proposal and its
contents form the basis of the insurance contract. The forms to be
completed to assess the risk for life insurance include the proposal
form, personal statement, agents report and medical reports (where
applicable). The underwriting process assesses the risk proposed to be
insured and is the basis of the decision to accept the offer for
insurance and on what terms insurance or decline the offer for
insurance. The IRDA regulations state that an insurer must notify the
proposer of their decision of acceptance or otherwise within a
stipulated period. Risk assessment involves looking at a number of
individual factors may affect mortality and making a determination of
the total effect of these individual effects on longevity of life</p>
