<hr>
<p>Lifeinsurance is commonly referred to as life assurance.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Section 2(11) of the Insurance Act, 1938 defines life insurance business
as follows: &ldquo;Life Insurance Business&rdquo; is the business of effecting
contracts of insurance upon human life, including any contract whereby
the payment of money is assured on death (except death by accident only)
or the happening of any contingency dependant on human life and any
contract which is subject to the payment of premiums for a term
dependant on human life.</p>
<h2 id="11-growth-of-insurance-business-in-india">1.1 Growth of Insurance business in India</h2>
<p>The growth of insurancebusiness in India started with the enactment of the Insurance Act, 1938.</p>
<h2 id="postal-life-insurance-pli">Postal Life Insurance (PLI)</h2>
<p>The PLI came into being on 1st February
1884, exclusively for the benefit of the employees of the postal
department. It was extended to the employees of the telegraph department
in 1988. After independence, the scheme was extended to cover the
employees of the Central and State governments, local bodies,
municipalities, the Reserve Bank of India, nationalised banks, public
sector undertakings, port trusts, universities and government aided
educational institutions, councils of scientific and industrial
research, railways and defence services. The scheme was made available
to the general public in rural areas with effect from 24 March 1995 and
was called Rural PLI.</p>
<h2 id="life-insurance-corporation-of-india-lic">Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)</h2>
<p>In 1956, the life insurancebusiness in India was nationalised and the
Life InsuranceCorporation ofIndia (LIC) was formed on 1st September 1956.
The entirelifeinsurance
business, which was in the hands of Indian companies, branches of
foreign companies and some provident societies were transferred to LIC.
The Postal Life Insurance (PLI) and the insurance departments of some
States were not merged with the LIC.</p>
<h2 id="further-changes">Further Changes</h2>
<p>Until 1999, LIC had the exclusive right over life
insurance business in India. In 1999, relevant laws were amended and the
life insurance sector was opened up for business to private players.</p>
<p>In 2010, there are 23 life insurance companies transacting life
insurance business in India</p>
<h2 id="12-liberalisation-of-the-indian-insurance-sector">1.2 Liberalisation of the Indian insurance sector</h2>
<p>Insurance in India is
governed by the Insurance Act, 1938 as amended from time to time. It
lays down the rules and regulations for the insurance industry. The
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) Act was enacted in
1999. IRDA is the regulator for insurance business in India. In the year
2000, the insurance sector was liberalised and opened up for business to
the private sector. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was allowed in
insurance up to 26%, wherein the foreign players were allowed to enter
into joint ventures with domestic players. Lot of domestic players
joined hands with foreign partners who brought in valuable expertise and
capital. Opening up of the insurance sector has led to emergence of
innovative insurance products and has also helped in deeper penetration
of insurance. Liberalisation brought in the much needed competition and
better customer service.</p>
<h2 id="13-list-of-private-life-insurance-companies-operating-in-india">1.3 List of private life insurance companies operating in India</h2>

<h2 id="learning-outcome-b">Learn about the activities and organisational structure of a life insurance company.
[Learning Outcome b]</h2>
<p>The two primary objectives of
life insurance companies are: To spread life insurance widely with a
view to reaching all insurable persons in the country and providing them
adequate financial cover against death, at a reasonable cost.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>In order to clear the road blocks in the expansion of insurance coverage
among lowincome segments, the IRDA has issued Micro-Insurance
Regulations 2005. The aim of these regulations is to spread life
insurance widely among the poor and the lowersegment people in the
country. To maximize mobilisation of people&rsquo;s savings by making
insurance-linked savings adequately attractive.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>Rajiv has taken a life insurance policy of Rs. 12 lakhs for 20 years at
a premium of Rs. 50,000 per year. He can easily save Rs. 50,000 each
year to pay as premium and get Rs. 12 lakhs after 20 years or his heirs
can get the money after his death during the term of policy. It is
certainly easier for him to save a small amount every year and get a
lump sum at the end of 20 years, than saving Rs. 12 lakhs himself.
Hence, life insurance helps to mobilise his savings so that he can get
the maximum amount at a later date.</p>
<h2 id="21-activities-of-the-life-insurance-company">2.1 Activities of the life insurance company</h2>
<h2 id="example-2">The essential activities ofa life insurance company are: a) Obtaining applications or proposals
from prospective buyers
Example</h2>
<p>Arun is a government officer. He is going to retire after 10 years. The
greatest risk he faces after retirement is the lack of income or reduced
earning capacity. MNO Life Insurance Company approached Arun with
different insurance plans. Arun applied for Annuity (Pension) Plan and
chose the option of getting pension during his lifetime. Arun filled up
the proposal form and furnished all material information required by MNO
Company. Examining and making decisions on the proposals for insurance
is called underwriting. Underwriting means analysing selection and
classifying of risk by assessing the economic, physical, medical and
social status of a person while accepting the risk for their life.</p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example</h2>
<h2 id="example-4">Vishal was appointed as the underwriting officer of MNO Life Insurance
Co. Ltd. His duty was to give the proposal a detailed consideration from
all angles and decide whether the risk is to be accepted at the standard
rate or a higher rate of premium and the overall terms of acceptance of
risk depending upon the risk involved. Issuing the insurance policy
document, incorporating the terms and conditions of the insurance cover
(insurance policy is a document that serves as an evidence of the
insurance contract between the insurance company and the policy-holder
.It conveys the details of the risk coverage of the company).
Example</h2>
<p>In Arun&rsquo;s example above, MNO Insurance Company assessed and reviewed
Arun&rsquo;s economic, physical and medical and social status. After being
satisfied, the company issued the policy document that set out the terms
and conditions of the contract.</p>
<h2 id="example-5">Keeping sight of conditions of the insurance contract by either party
e.g. timely payment of premium by the policy-holder and timely payment
of benefits as per the policy conditions by the insurance company.
Example</h2>
<h2 id="example-6">Continuing with the same example, MNO Insurance Company kept sight of
the terms of the contract and made timely survival benefit payment to
Arun in return for the timely payment of premium made by him. Attending
to various requirements such as nominations, assignments, surrenders,
payment of claims, alteration of terms and conditions during the term of
policy.
Example</h2>
<p>Neeraj is married to Kalyani and has two kids. He holds an insurance
policy. He nominated his wife in his insurance policy. This is essential
to avoid any dispute over the claim of insurance policy money after his
death. By nominating his wife, he made it clear that he wanted his wife
to get the insurance policy moneys in case of his death.</p>
<p>Other important activities such as compliance with laws and regulations
investment of funds, maintenance of accounts, management of personnel
etc.</p>
<h2 id="example-7">Example</h2>
<p>The Head Office of LIC is responsible for looking after extraordinary
activities such as judicious option of investment of funds, maintenance
of accounts etc.</p>
<h2 id="22-organisational-structure-of-the-life-insurance-corporation-of-indialic">2.2 Organisational structure of the Life Insurance Corporation of India(LIC)</h2>
<h2 id="a-organisation">Meaning of Organisation and organising
a) Organisation</h2>
<h2 id="definition-1">Definition</h2>
<p>An organisation is a legal entity which is created for some activity or
to achieve some purpose.</p>
<h2 id="example-8">It is the foundation upon which the whole structure of management is
built. In other words, it is a structure controlled by a group of
individuals who are working towards a common goal.
Example</h2>
<p>A company is the most common form of organisation as it is owned by a
group of shareholders, who have contributed to the capital of the
company. These shareholders have come together for the purpose of
achieving maximum profit. The total capital is divided into small units
called shares which are paid for by the shareholders.</p>
<p>An organisation is called a legal entity as it is lawfully authorised to
enter into contracts, sue and be sued in courts. An organisation has a
separate status and identity, and is considered to be a person in the
eyes of the law. As a person, it can collect wealth and do business.
Like a person, it can think, grow and occupy space. An organisation&rsquo;s
learning is the learning of its employees. When this learning is
recorded in the files of the organisation, and becomes available to the
other employees, the organisation is said to have learnt.</p>
<h2 id="b-organising">There are various forms of organisation. Companies, partnership firms,
proprietorship concerns, cooperative societies and trusts are the forms
of organisations that are registered under special laws. Life Insurance
Corporation of India is an organization created by a special Act, namely
the Insurance Act.
b) Organising</h2>
<h2 id="example-9">The word &lsquo;organising&rsquo; refers to the
arrangements made to enable the organisation to carry out its
activities, which are necessary in the course of business. The main
purpose behind organising is to ensure smooth functioning of the
activities of an organisation. Organising is to set up different levels
of offices or departments and sections, with distinct levels of
responsibilities for supervision and to staff them with people having
competence and authority to carry out the responsibilities.
Example</h2>
<h2 id="organisational-structure-of-the-life-insurance-corporation-of-india">The different activities carried out in a house would be cooking,
sleeping, bathing and cleaning. There are separate rooms for each of
these activities. There are separate equipments in the rooms for the
performance of these tasks. This is how a house is organised for it to
function smoothly.
In the same way, in an organisation, decisions are
made as to what activities have to be done, where and how. The way these
activities are grouped leads to formation of offices, departments and
sections. People have to be earmarked to do these activities.
Responsibilities for results have to be assigned and the authority to
take decisions has to be defined. When all these are clarified, there
will be people occupying places in offices with clear authority and
responsibility. An organisation is then said to be in order. The
&lsquo;structure&rsquo; of an organisation refers to this arrangement of departments
and sections and the authorities and responsibilities vested in the
various positions. The structure helps in stabilising processes and
avoiding wasteful conflicts.

<p>The 23 private life insurance companies have started operations on various
dates between 2001 and 2009. All of them operate only in India. In the
initial stages, most of them started with a two &ndash; tier structure: head
office and branch offices reporting to head office. As the business
expanded, many of them have increased not only the number of offices,
but also the tiers. Many of them have zonal and regional offices between
the Head Office or Corporate Office and the branches. This has become
necessary as the new companies have been expanding their network,
opening more branch offices.</p>

<h2 id="31-introduction">3.1 Introduction</h2>
<h2 id="example-11">Life Insurance in India today, is sold in more than one ways viz: Agents Telemarketing,
Internet sales, Brokers, Corporate agents etc. For some years now, there
has been a rise in insurance telemarketing. Numerous insurance companies
are engaged in providing insurance. They are very well trained in the
art of ethical selling and customer service. In simple language, an
agent is one who acts on behalf of another. The person on whose behalf
the agent acts is called the principal.
Example</h2>
<h2 id="example-12">The lawyer is the agent of the client, when they argue a case in court.
Example</h2>
<p>An ambassador is an agent of their country.
The persons who do the job
of meeting, explaining and persuading potential customers are called
insurance agents. They are the salesmen or intermediaries between the
insurer and the public. Agents have to be licensed from the IRDA under
the Insurance Act. A licensed agent can work with only one life insurer
of their choice. Agents may be individuals or corporate bodies.</p>
<h2 id="example-13">There is also a system of insurance brokers. They are independent and
not attached with any particular insurer. A broker usually does business
with more than one insurance company. An insurance broker is someone who
represents more than one insurance company, unlike an insurance agent
who represents only one insurance company. A broker is a mediator
between the customer and the insurance companies, charging commission
only from the insurer.
Example</h2>
<p>Ram is a life insurance agent with XYZ Life
Insurance Company. He met his client, Mrs Roy, and offered her various
policies of XYZ Company, to suit her needs. Mrs Roy bought the endowment
plan for 20 years from Ram. Later, she got her address changed through
Ram on her policy records, as she had moved to a new home. This is how
an agent brings in new business and provides services throughout the
term. Ajay, an insurance broker, offered his client, Mr Shaikh, term
insurance policies of 10 different companies to choose the most suitable
one. Mr Shaikh bought a 25 lakhs term plan of AAA Life Insurance
Company. Ajay would get his commission from Company. He would also be
able to provide service for Mr Shaikh&rsquo;s policy with AAA Company as and
when needed. In this chapter, the word &lsquo;agent&rsquo; is used to refer to all
salesmen, whether called an agent, corporate agent, bank, broker,
insurance advisor, consultant or by any other name.</p>
<h2 id="32-need-of-an-agent-in-insurance-selling">3.2 Need of an agent in insurance selling</h2>
<p>Agents are essential for
selling life insurance due to the following reasons: Insurance is a
concept that needs to be explained face to face. Personalised guidance
can be given only when there is personal interaction between the agent
and the customer. The agent gets to meet the proposer personally.
Therefore, the agent is in a position to provide valuable information
such as details on personal styles, habits, family etc. which is
important for risk evaluation and also helps to understand the special
needs of the prospective customer. The agent can explain to the customer
how insurance is not just another investment avenue, but provides timely
financial security as well. Each prospective buyer has special needs and
requires specialised solutions. Personalised guidance can be given only
when there is a live interaction with the agent.</p>
<h2 id="example-14">Example</h2>
<p>Atul wishes to buy a life insurance policy. He doesn&rsquo;t know whom to
approach. He logs on to the website of an insurance company, but still
cannot understand which product (policy) would be suitable for him. So,
he goes to his friend for help. His friend sends an insurance agent,
Lalit to him. Lalit tells Atul about the different insurance products
available, along with a recommendation of which one would be good for
him and also clears all his doubts. This is how Lalit, an insurance
agent, acts as an intermediary between Atul, the proposer and the
insurer. The Life Insurance Corporation of India has more than 13 lakh
agents on its rolls. Some of them are full time while some work part
time. The other companies are also steadily adding to their agent base.
The Postal Life Insurance appoints unemployed youth and extra
departmental branch postmasters to procure business under the Rural PLI.
Retired employees of the Posts and Telegraphs department and of the
Railways are employed as Field Officers, on commission basis to get
business.</p>

<h2 id="example-15">Example</h2>
<p>Deepak aspires to be an insurance agent. He is 20 years old, intelligent
and an honest man. He approaches the Development Officer of the LIC. It
is the duty of the Development Officer to recruit and train suitable
persons as agents. The Development Officer finds Deepak suitable to
become an insurance agent because: He is not a minor. He is not a person
of unsound mind. He is not guilty of any criminal breach of trust. He
fulfils all the criteria mentioned in the diagram above. However, the
Development Officer tells Deepak that he needs to undergo practical
training for at least 50 hours from an institution approved by the IRDA
and also pass the pre-recruitment exams conducted by any examination
body recognised by the IRDA. The prospective candidates would have to
give their particulars in a format called the application form and
subject themselves to a written test, prescribed by the IRDA and also a
personal interview. The prospective candidates can be found through:
press advertisements reference from other agents, staff, clients visit
to college campuses employment agencies members of staff It is not just
individuals who can become agents. Companies, firms, banks, cooperative
societies etc. can also become agents. These will have to designate one
or more persons as &lsquo;Corporate Insurance Executives&rsquo;, who will be
required to obtain licences like individual agents. Other members or
employees of the organisation can also work for the corporate agent and
they are called &lsquo;specified persons&rsquo;. They also need to obtain
certificates. In LIC, there are supervisory level employees between the
agent and the branch office. They are called Development Officers. They
are regular salaried employees and their duty is to recruit and train
suitable persons as agents. These intermediaries can also be called
Agency Supervisors, Agency Managers etc. Besides agents appointed by
Development Officers, there are Direct Agents and Career Agents. Direct
Agents are senior experienced agents, who work independently and report
directly to the Branch Manager. Career Agents are selected by the LIC
directly on the basis of tests and interviews and are later given
extensive training.</p>
<h2 id="34-functions-of-the-agent">3.4 Functions of the agent</h2>
<h2 id="test-yourself-2">The major function of the agent is to solicit
and procure life insurance business for the insurer, who has appointed
him as an agent. The regulations framed by the IRDA lay down a code of
conduct, which says that the agent shall: Identify himself and the
insurance company of which he is an agent. Disclose the licence to the
prospect on demand. Explain all available options to the prospect.
Recommend a suitable plan taking into account the needs of the prospect.
Explain the nature and importance of information asked for in the
proposal form. Impress upon the prospect the need to disclose all
material information truthfully. Make all enquiries about the prospect
his /her family history, medical history, special medical reports,
admission of age etc. Inform the insurer about any material fact, e.g.
habits, that could affect the underwriting decision. Inform the prospect
about the acceptance or rejection of the policy. Ensure delivery of the
policy to the insured. Advise policyholders to make nominations. Give
assistance to policyholders and claimants in complying with the
requirements.

following ways: payment of fixed monthly salary; payment of commission
related to the business; or part payment of fixed salary and part
payment of commission based on business done</p>
<h2 id="42-commission-to-agents">4.2 Commission to agents</h2>
<p>Commission to agents is specified as a
percentage of premiums paid. The percentage may differ from year to year
and from product to product. Bonus commission may be payable on the
first year premium as an incentive for higher performance. This could be
a percentage of the eligible first year commission. The rates of
percentage may increase as the amount of first year commission
increases. Commission may be paid right through the term of the policy
or may be paid only for a fixed number of years. Hence, every time a
policyholder pays their instalment premium, the agent receives the
commission. In the Insurance Act, there is a provision whereby agents
are entitled to receive commission for the rest of their lives and
later, the heirs can receive the commission after the agent&rsquo;s death: if
the agents have worked for at least five years and at least business of
Rs. 50,000 has been done one year prior to cessation of agency; or if
they have worked for at least 10 years</p>

policyholders (called rebating) in order to increase their business.
This is illegal and offering concession (rebates) to policyholders is
not allowed as per section 41 of the Insurance Act 1938. This leads to
cancellation of the agent&rsquo;s licence. In addition, the agent has to pay
penalty.</p>

<h2 id="learning-outcome-e">Discuss the trends in life insurance distribution channel.
[Learning Outcome e]</h2>
<p>Agency and brokerage systems are the most common and
contribute the maximum share of life insurance business in developing
countries and even developed countries. In India, the contribution from
brokers is very little in the life insurance business. The Japanese Life
Insurance industry depends mostly upon agents. Part-time agents and
women agents form a good proportion of the agency force.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-4">In European countries, notably France, Holland, Belgium and Spain
distribution also takes place through banks (Bancassurance). Banks are
being used extensively in India as &ldquo;corporate agents&rdquo; by almost all
insurers. The advantage with banks is their extensive network in the
interior parts of the country and the fact that customers of banks are
the natural customers for insurance. Direct mailing is becoming
increasingly popular in developed countries. In a small way, this has
also started in India. The scope and the experience are being observed.
In India, life insurers are using banks as intermediaries. Some insurers
depend heavily on business from banks as corporate agents. Some insurers
resort to direct marketing, contacting prospects through telephones,
direct mails and the internet. In the year 2008-2009, about 97% of
business LIC came through individual agents. In the case of private
insurers, individual agents contributed about 83%, with corporate agents
and banks contributing about 8% each and the balance through other modes
like web-portals or direct mailer business..

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In the case of life insurance, the insurer agrees to pay the
insured or their heirs, a certain sum of money on death or on the
happening of an event dependent upon human life, in consideration of
premiums paid by the assured. In 1956, the life insurance business in
India was nationalised and the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)
was formed on 1st September 1956. In India, in the year 2000, the
insurance sector was opened up to private players. The primary objective
of Life Insurance Companies is to spread life insurance widely and to
maximise mobilisation of people&rsquo;s savings. The Life Insurance
Corporation transacts business throughout India with a four tier
structure. Agents are essential for selling life insurance. The major
function of the agent is to solicit and procure life insurance business
for the insurer. Agents maybe remunerated in terms of fixed monthly
salary or commission as a percentage of premium paid. All insurers
insist that a minimum amount of business must be done by an agent in
each agency year. The agency may be terminated on non-fulfilment of the
minimum business requirements.</p>
