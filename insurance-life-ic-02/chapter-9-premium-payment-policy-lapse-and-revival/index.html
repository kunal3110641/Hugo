<h2 id="an-introductory-overview">An Introductory Overview</h2>
<p>Lifeinsurance is an agreement that assures payment of a stated amount of
money at the end of a specified term or on the death of the life insured
if the client keeps his promise of paying his premium in time. It
provides for financial security in the event of death or on the
inability to earn due to physical disabilities. A life insurance policy
is a long term contract between the policyholder and the life insurance
company. The payment of premium is normally spread over the term of a
policy. A policyholder has to pay the premium on or before the due date.
Some people - due to unexpected uncertainties - are sometimes unable to
pay the premium on time. The reasons can be many. It can be due to loss
of a job, unexpected and extensive medical expenses, forgetting to pay
the premium on the due date, or losing interest in continuing with the
policy. Sometimes people land in a financial crisis and can't afford to
pay any further premiums. No matter what the reason is for not paying
the premium, it&rsquo;s important to know the possible consequences of not
making timely payment of insurance policy premium. The effect depends on
the type of policy and coverage the individual has and the terms and
conditions of the policy. An individual&rsquo;s inability to pay the premium
due can result in lapsing of the policy, thereby triggering the chances
of reducing or losing the policy benefits thereunder. A lapsed policy
can have serious consequences. If something happens to the bread winner,
the dependents may be left with no source of income, if you stop paying
premiums and let your policy lapse, you would lose valuable insurance
protection and monetary benefits from it, thereby leaving your family at
a financial risk. Actually, life insurance is the link that can provide
financial protection to the family if the bread earner dies prematurely.
Death benefit proceeds from a life insurance policy can provide the
liquidity to settle final expenses, pay off debts, meet goals like
children&rsquo;s education and marriage expenses.</p>
<p>This chapter will give a detailed account of different modes of premium
payment, circumstances in which a policy lapses and different ways in
which a lapsed policy can be revived.</p>

<h2 id="11-how-are-premiums-calculated">1.1 How are premiums calculated</h2>
<p>Premium is the consideration paid by the insured person for purchasing the
insurance product. Premium is to be paid by the insured person at the
commencement of contract and thereafter throughout the term at
periodical intervals as per the terms of the policy. The rates of
premium vary as per age, term and benefits offered under the type of
product. There are several factors considered by insurance companies for
arriving at the premium to be charged. Some of these factors include
age, gender, profession, health conditions, profession and family
history etc. of the prospect applying for insurance. Factors affecting
the premium</p>
<p>Age</p>
<p>For people belonging to a given age bracket say 31 &ndash; 40 years, the
higher the age, the higher will be the premium. Given that all other
factors are same in this age bracket, the premium for the person aged 31
years will be the lowest and the premium for the person aged 40 years
will be the highest. Insurance companies charge different premiums for
males and</p>
<p>Sex</p>
<p>females based on their exposure to risks and longevity. People who are
in professions where risk is more than other normal professions are
charged higher premiums. For example, people Profession working in
underground mines and explosive factories are exposed to higher risks
than people in other professions such as the IT industry. People who
consume tobacco and alcohol or smoke beyond certain Habits</p>
<p>levels may be charged higher premiums compared to other people. Health
People in good health will be charged lower premiums than people
Conditions suffering from some diseases, disorders, ailments and
disabilities. If there is a strong family history of ailments like
diabetes, cancer, heart problems etc. then the life to be assured may be
charged a Family</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>higher premium as compared to others, as science has proven that</p>
<p>the likelihood of the life-to-be-assured suffering from such diseases /
disorders in future being very high</p>
<p>The above list of factors affecting the premiums is just indicative and
not an exhaustive one. While these are some of the important factors
influencing premiums, insurance companies do factor in many other
factors in the process of arriving at premiums. Premiums are worked out
on the basis of probabilities. Hobbies of a person can also influence
the premium. These can include hobbies such as: Mountaineering Para
Gliding Water Sports Trekking</p>
<p>The insurer refers to internal manuals or guidelines which specify the
parameters of the hazard and work out the appropriate extra premium, if
the life-to be assured participates in such hobbies or avocations. If
the risk is assessed to be greater than the standard, it is described as
sub-standard and a higher premium may be charged. If smoking is
considered a hazard, a standard premium is fixed for non-smokers.
Smokers may be charged a higher premium. If the extra risk is assessed
to be very high, the insurer may also decline the proposal for
insurance, as no amount of extra premium is sufficient to take care of
the very high extra risk. If the applicant is suffering from terminal
cancer, the chances of his survival for even one year are remote in view
of the advanced stage that he is in. In such type of cases the insurance
company may decline the proposal for insurance as the risk involved is
extremely high. If such a case is accepted even with a very high extra
premium in view of the high risk profile, the policy will result in a
claim in the very first year of the policy, resulting in jeopardising
the actuarial assumptions while also impacting both; the revenue of the
insurer and the portfolio of policy-holders adversely.</p>
<h2 id="12-age">1.2 Age</h2>
<p>Nowadays, age of the life insured is proved and admitted at the
commencement itself because age is an important factor that influences
the contract. Both risk assessment and premium depend on age. The claim
cannot be finally settled unless age is admitted.</p>
<p>If age remains to be proved when the claim arises, there could be delays
in settling the claim. In the recent years, the process of age-admission
is ensured prior to the issue of policy, as this avoids calling for
age-proof from the clients at the maturity payment stage / claimants
while settling death claims. It also helps that there is no
understatement and overstatement of age related issues after the
commencement of the policy. This process also ensures settling death
claims faster without the procedure of the claimants having to submit
the proof of age of the deceased person. Age seems fairly simple to
determine. However, many life insurance companies see it in a different
way. Age of the policyholder on the date of the commencement of the
policy needs to be calculated by insurance companies. Some insurers, for
calculating age, consider only the number of years completed and ignore
months and days. There are three methods using which the age of the
policyholder can be determined Age next birthday: life insurance
companies calculate premiums based on the age that an individual will
achieve on his next birthday. In other words the age as on the birthday
coming after the commencement of policy.</p>
<p>Scenario 1 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance plan. Age
will be</p>
<p>4th July 1982 4th Dec 2010</p>
<p>29 years</p>
<p>Scenario 2 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance plan. Age
will be</p>
<p>10 Oct 1976 th 11 Aug 2010 34 years</p>
<p>Age last birthday: this method is also known as actual age method. In
this method insurance companies calculate age based on the last
birthday. In other words the age is taken as on the birthday coming
before the commencement of policy.</p>
<p>Scenario 1 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance plan. Age
will be</p>
<p>4th July 1982 4th Dec 2010</p>
<p>28 years</p>
<p>Scenario 2 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance plan. Age
will be</p>
<p>10 Oct 1976 th 11 Aug 2010 33 years</p>
<p>Age nearest birthday: In this method insurance companies calculate the
age based on the nearest birthday, which could be either the last
birthday or next birthday. In other words, generally, the age is taken
as on the birthday within 6 months before or after the date of
commencement of policy.</p>
<p>Scenario 1 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance plan. Age

<p>4th July 1982 4th Dec 2010</p>
<p>28 years</p>
<p>Scenario 2 Date of birth Date of commencement of the insurance policy.
Age will be</p>
<p>10 Oct 1976 th 11 Aug 2010 34 years</p>
<p>Most life insurance companies use the Age Nearest Birthday method for
age determination.</p>
<p>Mis-statement of age is generally dealt with, through the following
three methods: If the age is proved higher than stated at the proposal
stage and his corrected higher age makes him uninsurable for the plan or
product that he has already been issued, this policy will have to be
cancelled and a new policy issued under another plan after underwriting
is done (and subject to him being found insurable) ,then, all terms and
conditions of the new plan will become applicable .In case, there is no
plan that can be issued to him with the corrected higher age, then the
policy will be cancelled from the date of issue of the policy and
premium or contribution made to the insurer will stand refunded without
interest and subject to deductions of expenses incurred and payments
already made by the insurer under the policy.</p>
<p>If the correct age of the life-assured is found to be higher than the
age declared in the proposal, and he is found to be uninsurable at this
stage, then the premium or contribution made will be suitably corrected
from the date of commencement from the policy and the accumulated
difference in premium is calculated If the age proved at a later date is
lower than what was mentioned in the proposal form then the premium or
contribution payable under the policy shall be modified to the premium
corresponding to the lower age of the life-assured and the corrected
premium from the date of commencement of the policy. The insurer, based
on their terms and conditions may, Refund without interest the
accumulated difference between the original premium or contribution paid
and the corrected premium or contribution. All these situations are
avoided with the practice of proving the correct age at commencement of
the policy. In the case of Postal Life Insurance (PLI), the clause in
the policy says that (i) if age is proved to be lower than what was
proved earlier justifying a lower premium, forthcoming premiums will be
reduced, but there will be no adjustments for the past premiums paid at
the higher rate and (ii) if the age is proved to be higher justifying a
higher premium, the policy will be treated as null and void and the
premium forfeited. This clause exists although age is admitted at the
outset, mostly on the basis of service records. There could be occasions
to modify ages already proved and admitted.</p>
<h2 id="13-premium">1.3 Premium</h2>
<p>The preamble in the policy acknowledges receipt of the first
premium. The Operative clause refers to the obligation of the insured to
pay subsequent premiums as set out in the Schedule of the Policy. The
first premium paid is the consideration for the life insurance contract
to come into force. The payment of subsequent premiums is the condition
necessary for the contract to continue to remain in force. The policy
document will state: the dates on which premiums have to be paid the
place/s where premium has to be paid. in the event of failure to pay
premiums on the due date, the policy will lapse.</p>
<p>This means that the policy will effectively terminate subject to
safeguards written in the terms and conditions of the policy and the
law. Insurers do not enforce these conditions as rigidly as they are
stated and provide a grace period (normally 30 days) to pay the premium
after due date.</p>
<h2 id="timing-of-payment-of-premium">Timing of payment of premium</h2>
<p>Premiums are normally payable in yearly,
half-yearly, quarterly or monthly instalments. Monthly payment of
premium involves much more administrative work, like issue of receipts
and accounting and adjustments, 12 times compared to once, in a yearly
mode of premium payment. A single premium, for an insurance policy
suggests that there is no great need for insurance, as the policyholder
is able to set aside a big enough sum of money. A single premium for an
immediate annuity however, is commonly done. People, who retire, deposit
their savings with the insurer for a regular annuity. Some insurers do
not allow monthly payments because of the additional work involved. Some
insurers accept the monthly mode only if it is paid through a bank by
way of standing instructions (ECS) or under SSS schemes. The advantage
here is that the payments would be regular and the chances of default
are less.</p>
<h2 id="calculation-of-premium">Calculation of Premium</h2>
<p>Premiums are calculated on the published rates.
However, monthly premium may not be just one-twelfth of the yearly
premium. There could be a small addition of say 58% of the tabular rate
before calculating the monthly premium.</p>
<p>This is to provide for the additional administrative costs. On the
contrary, there could be small reductions, called rebates or discounts,
while calculating the yearly and halfyearly modes. In calculating
instalment premium, care has to be taken to deduct permissible rebate
(concession) for mode of payment and sum proposed for insurance. The
rebates are offered for annual and half yearly mode of premium because
there is less administrative cost and also the insurer gets the premium
at the beginning of the year itself and hence can earn higher returns on
it. These practices vary between insurers and depend on how a particular
insurer has worked out its premium rates. The premium for an insurance
policy of Rs. 25,000.00 may not be just 25 times the premium for an
insurance policy of Rs 1000.00. This is because of adjustments justified
by the distribution of overhead costs. Some costs are variable costs,
like commission, and depend on the premium. But some costs are constant.
The cost of printing a policy and creating the records for future
servicing are the same, whatever is the size of the policy. This is the
reason why there is differentiation in premium rates between policies of
lower premium amounts and policies of higher premium amounts. These
differences are referred to as Sum Assured rebates.</p>

<h2 id="14-place-of-payment-of-premium">1.4 Place of payment of premium</h2>
<p>The policy conditions stipulate that
premiums must be paid in the office of the insurer by the due date.
Strictly, this means that premium will be considered to have been paid
only when it is received in the specified office of the insurer. Some
years ago, the practice was that premiums paid in the office of an
insurer other than the specified office, would not be adjusted till it
is transferred to the specified office. This situation has changed these
days, particularly with the applications of information technology. The
premium can now be paid at any of the Branches, and not necessarily the
Branch where the policy was procured. The current technology advancement
allows the premium to be paid electronically through the internet,
credit cards, phone-banking etc. Payment of premium through an
authorised collecting agent like a bank is also used as one of the modes
for collecting premium. &ldquo;Dropboxes&rdquo; at convenient locations are also
used for collecting premium. The obligation of a policyholder to pay the
premium as stipulated is not conditional on the insurer making a demand
for the premium. In other words, it is not obligatory for the insurer to
remind the policyholder that a premium is due. Yet many insurers do send
such reminders, which are called premium notices. Receipts are issued
for renewal premium payments. These renewal premium receipts (RPRs) may
be required to prove that the premium has been paid, in case, there is a
dispute whether a particular premium has been paid or not.</p>
<h2 id="grace-periods-allowed-in-payment">Grace periods allowed in payment</h2>
<p>A grace period is an extended period of
time a policyholder is permitted for making the premium payment after
the due date. Depending on the mode of the premium, the grace period is
generally 15 days for monthly mode and not less than 30 days for
quarterly, half yearly &amp; yearly mode of premium. If the last day of the
grace period is a holiday, the practice is to extend it to the next
working day. Grace period is 15 days in case of monthly mode of premium
and 30 days or 31 days in all other cases. The policy continues to
remain in force during days of grace, even if premium is not paid. If
death occurs within the grace period, the claim is paid in full though
the policy is in full force, subject to the deduction of the last unpaid
premium during the current year of the policy.</p>
<p>Rita is not able to pay her monthly insurance premium when it is due. It
is due on 20.3.2008, but she will be able to pay the premium only by
31.3.2008. She calls her insurance agent and asks her what she should
do. The insurance agent tells Rita that she has a 15 day grace period to
pay her insurance premium and there will be no extra charge to pay the
premium within that grace period. She also assured Rita that her
insurance coverage will not cease as long as her insurance payment is
received within the 15 day grace period.</p>
<h2 id="salary-saving-scheme-sss-scheme">Salary Saving Scheme (SSS) scheme</h2>
<p>In case of SSS policies, premiums are
deducted from the employee&rsquo;s salary before it is paid to him and the
total premium deducted for all SSS policies is sent by the employer
along with the list of policy numbers to the insurer. The due date is
made the same for all SSS policies. Due date may be close to the last
date of the month, not far from the salary date. The &lsquo;days of grace&rsquo;
clause is not enforced in SSS cases. If deduction has been made by the
employer, the premium is deemed to have been paid on time, even if it is
received late. When the premium is received by cheque through employer
demand draft or banker&rsquo;s cheque, it is adjusted immediately and the
receipt issued &lsquo;subject to clearance&rsquo;. This is done to reduce the
clerical work, as very few of these cheques are dishonoured. This means
that credit is given for premium even before the money is credited into
the insurer&rsquo;s account. Also, the date on which payment was paid to the
collecting bank, would be considered as the date of payment of premium,
even though money will actually be received by the insurer after some
time.</p>
<h2 id="premium-in-case-of-postal-life-insurance-pli">Premium in case of Postal Life insurance (PLI)</h2>

<h2 id="learning-outcome-b">Discuss surrender value and non-forfeiture options
[Learning Outcome b]</h2>
<h2 id="21-surrender-value">2.1 Surrender Value</h2>
<p>Policy conditions state that if premium is not
paid within the grace period, the policy lapses. If viewed very strictly
no claim need be admitted by the insurer after the policy lapses and the
premiums be forfeited. Despite such strict conditions, insurers have
practices which are more beneficial to policyholders. The reason for not
enforcing the insurer&rsquo;s rights is because, under the principles of
insurance, such total forfeiture will not be justified. The law, also,
taking due note of the insurance principles, does not permit such total
forfeiture. Therefore, the policy conditions have non-forfeiture clauses
allowing protection to the policy holders.</p>
<h2 id="meaning-of-surrender-value">Meaning of surrender value</h2>
<p>It is the amount the policyholder will get
from the life insurance company if he decides to exit the policy before
maturity. A mid-term surrender would result in the policyholder getting
a sum that has been allocated towards savings and the earnings thereon.
From this will be deducted a surrender charge, which varies from policy
to policy.</p>
<p>The relevant insurance principle is mainly related to the concept of
level premium.</p>
<p>When premiums are charged uniformly throughout the term of the policy,
it will be higher than what is required to cover risk, at younger ages
and much lower than what is required at the advanced ages. The higher
premium paid by a policyholder in the initial years of a policy has to
be held on the policyholder&rsquo;s account (in the life fund) for future and
cannot be forfeited by the insurer. Also the premium has a savings
component to be accumulated for payment of survival benefit. This is a
liability, which cannot be extinguished totally, even if the policy does
not continue to be in force. Unlike in a bank account, the insurer does
not maintain a separate account for each policyholder or policy,
indicating how much is the balance to the credit of the account. The
insurer has only one life fund into which all revenues flow in and from
which all claims (death as well as maturity) are paid. This fund is a
pool of all policyholders&rsquo; accounts. This is so because the death claims
can be paid only by drawing from the contributions of the policyholders.
This is the basic insurance principle of sharing. Yet, it is possible to
work out how much is each policyholder&rsquo;s credit in the total life fund.
The method of involves technical, actuarial and statistical principles.
The share of each policyholder in the life fund is a notional figure. It
is the result of higher premiums paid in the early years of the policy
premium paid for survivorship benefits interest earned on these excess
premiums These notional credits to each policy account are treated as
the policyholder&rsquo;s entitlement at all times. It is due to be returned to
him when the policy is closed or discontinued, before completion of the
full term. This amount is called the &ldquo;surrender value&rdquo; or the &ldquo;cash
value&rdquo;. It is the surrender value that makes total forfeiture unfair and
justifies non-forfeiture options.</p>
<h2 id="conditions-for-availability-of-surrender-value">Conditions for availability of surrender value</h2>
<p>Surrender value or cash
value is made available generally when the policy has remained in force
for at least three years. The premiums during the first three years are
unlikely to have any surplus for accumulation, because of heavy initial
costs of procuring business. This is particularly so, in the case of low
premium policies. Surrender values will vary the same way</p>
<p>A year long illness resulted in Ramesh&rsquo;s life insurance premium of LIC
being overdue for 11 months, just before his death. Since the policy
premium was paid for more than five-years the claim was admissible.
According to LIC&rsquo;s policy provisions for such cases, if death occurs
within 12 months from the last unpaid due and the policy is more than
five years old, LIC pays the full claim after deducting the outstanding
unpaid premiums with interest. As per Section 113 of Insurance Act 1938,
all policies which have been in force for at least three years, are
entitled to receive a guaranteed surrender value, which must be shown on
the policy document. LIC policies promise a guaranteed surrender value
of not less than 30 per cent of the total amount of premium paid,
excluding premiums for the first year. The actual surrender value in any
case will be more than this minimum value. The formula may differ from
one company to the other and from one product to another. The
calculation of surrender value is done after paid up value calculation
as paid up value is needed for the calculation of surrender value</p>
<h2 id="22-non-forfeiture-options">2.2 Non-forfeiture options</h2>
<p>In the event of a policy lapsing because of
non-payment of premium, the following options are available: payment of
surrender value or cash value reduced paid-up value for the remaining
term of the policy Automatic advance of future premiums until the
surrender value is exhausted Extended term insurance cover available on
the basis of the net surrender value Surrender value or cash value has
already been discussed above. Reduced paid up value option Under the
option of the reduced paid-up value, the policy continues to be in
force, with the only change that the SA (Sum Assured) will stand reduced
to a lower figure. The reduced SA is such that it bears the same ratio
to the full SA, as the number of premiums actually paid bears to the
total number originally stipulated to be paid.</p>
<p>If the sum assured is Rs. 10,000.00 and the total number of premiums
payable is 50 (i.e. term 25 years and mode of payment half yearly) and
the payment of premium is discontinued after 25 half yearly instalments
are paid, the policy acquires a paid-up value of Rs. 5000.00 as per the
calculations shown below. Total number of premiums payable 50 (@ half
yearly premiums for 25 years) Number of premiums paid 25 Original Sum
Assured 10000 Paid up value = Number of premiums paid x Sum Assured
Total No. of premiums payable = 25 x 10000 50 = Rs. 5000/The bonus which
may have already vested in the policy will be added to this figure. If
the bonus accrued in last 12 and a half years is Rs. 600 per thousand,
then Paid up value = 5000 + (Accrued bonus X sum assured) / 1000 5000 +
(600 X 10000) / 1000 5000 + 6000 11,000 In the same example, if
surrender value rate is 80%, Then surrender value = Paid up value x
surrender value rate / 100 In the above example, surrender value = 11000
x 80 / 100 = Rs. 8800 When a policy is paid up, it is free from future
payment of premiums. The paid up value becomes the reduced SA payable on
maturity or on death, as per the conditions of the policy. If other
benefits related to the SA are payable, the benefits will now be related
to the paid-up value. Insurance companies may provide for a minimum
amount that must be acquired as paid up value. If the paid up value
(reduced SA), as calculated above is less than the stipulated minimum,
this option would not be available. The surrender value will be paid and
the policy closed.</p>
<p>Automatic advance of future premiums options The option of automatic
advance of future premiums becomes possible by notionally advancing
loans, equal to the premium fallen due, from the surrender value
available on the date of lapse. This can continue as long as the total
premiums advanced, is less than surrender value. (Incidentally, the
surrender value will increase with every premium advanced and treated as
paid). At a stage when surrender value is not sufficient to advance the
premium falling due, the policy will be finally closed and any surrender
value left over will be paid to the policyholder. Many insurers prior to
nationalisation and some in India now, offer this option of automatic
advance premium from surrender value. There are few advantages and
disadvantages attached to this option: The advantage is that the policy
continues without any reduction in benefits. Bonus also will be added.
The disadvantage is that after some time the surrender value gets
exhausted and at that stage the policyholder gets practically nothing.
It is as if all the premiums paid till then have gone waste. There is a
sense of having been &lsquo;cheated &lsquo;. People do not understand that they had
a risk cover for a longer period. Because of the likely intense
disappointment, insurers offer this option only on specific request.
This option will be useful in cases where the default in payment of
premium is because of some temporary difficulties, expected to be
overcome very soon. In case of policies of some insurers, this condition
operates unless the policyholder opts for a paid up policy. Extended
Term Insurance cover option Extended term insurance is a type of life
insurance designed to make traditional life insurance products more
attractive. Here are the basics of extended term life insurance and how
it works. Under the option of Extended Term Insurance cover, the insurer
converts the policy into a single premium term insurance for the full
sum assured of the policy for such a period as the net surrender value
will purchase at the insured&rsquo;s age at the time of lapsation of the
policy. Under the extended term cover option, the policy remains in full
force for the full SA, for a limited period, instead of a reduced amount
of insurance remaining in force for the entire policy period, as
provided in the option of paid up value. The amount required to be
advanced from the surrender value under this option, would be less than
the premium advanced under the automatic advance of the premium option.
Therefore, the benefit would last a little longer. But the sense of
being cheated at some time cannot be avoided. Generally, insurers in
India do not allow this option.</p>
<p>Question 2 What is the minimum number of years a policy must be kept to
be able to get surrender value in traditional plans? 2 years 1 year 3

<h2 id="learning-outcome-c">Learn about the ways in which lapsed policy can be revived
[Learning Outcome c]</h2>
<h2 id="31-need-and-meaning-of-revival-of-policy">3.1 Need and meaning of revival of policy</h2>
<p>When a policy lapses, neither the insurer nor the insured is benefited. The life
assured loses the life insurance cover. It signifies a reversal of
decision to arrange for the insurance cover. He also loses the full
benefits for what he had paid for, till then. The insurer loses the
further expected revenues and therefore, calculations for the future,
are upset. The costs expected to be recovered from premiums due in
future, are lost. The agent loses his future earnings. Normally, people
having bad health, value their insurance cover and continue the
policies, while others with normal health may discontinue the policies.
In that case, when a policy lapses, there is adverse selection or
selection against the insurer which means that the insurer&rsquo;s liability
becomes greater than what was assumed, while fixing the cost of
insurance. As lapsing adversely affects all parties, and also a lapse is
not always intended by the insured to happen, insurers facilitate the
reversal of lapsed policies. This is called &lsquo;revival&rsquo;. The word
&lsquo;revival&rsquo; means &rsquo;to bring back to life&rsquo;. There are various schemes for
revival and the procedures will vary between insurers. A revival
requires that the arrears of premiums be paid with interest. However, if
a long period had elapsed after the last premium was paid, the interest
on the accumulated arrears of premium could be very heavy. It may then
be more beneficial for the policyholder to take out a fresh policy
instead of trying to revive the lapsed one. LIC and many other insurers
do not allow revival after five years of lapse, for this reason.</p>
<p>On the revival of a lapsed policy which has become paid up, the risk
cover under that policy is being increased. Therefore, the process of
revival is treated on the same lines as underwriting a new proposal for
an amount of SA equal to the amount to be revived. Accordingly, the
policyholder will have to produce proof of continued insurability. The
nature of the proof would be the same as if a new proposal is being
considered for the extent of the additional risk, non-medical or medical
as the case may be. If a policy is being kept in force under the option
of automatic advance of premium from surrender value, the risk cover or
any other benefits under the policy have remained unaffected. Therefore
revival requires only that the amounts advanced from the surrender value
be paid. This would be equal to the arrears of premium with interest.
Therefore, there would be no need for any proof of continued good
health. However, if the premium was being advanced from the surrender
value for a long period say, nearly five years, the policyholder must
look at the advantage of surrendering the policy, instead of interest
accumulating on a compound basis.</p>
<h2 id="32-different-revival-schemes">3.2 Different revival schemes</h2>
<p>Subject to the requirements of proof of
continued good health and insurability and arrears of premium, the
insurers offer offers different schemes of revival. Some insurers do
have innovative schemes. The norms and types of revival may vary from
one insurer to another. The one illustrated below is the one followed by
LIC since the last so many years: Ordinary Revival Scheme Special
Revival Scheme Instalment Revival scheme Loan-Cum-Revival Scheme</p>
<p>Ordinary Revival Scheme The ordinary revival scheme followed by one
insurer is indicated below. The rules for revival could vary from one
insurer to another.</p>
<p>Diagram 1: Ordinary Revival Scheme without evidence of good health (as
followed by one of the insurance companies)</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Premium_payment_Policy_lapse_and_revival_91.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>The ordinary revival scheme generally asks for a satisfactory
&lsquo;Declaration of Good Health&rsquo; in a simple form Special Revival Scheme The
special revival scheme which is followed by one of the insurance
companies is designed to meet the needs of policy holders who are
interested in reviving the policy, but are unable to pay all the arrears
of premium with interest. Revival under this scheme (as followed by one
of the insurers) may be allowed if the following conditions are
satisfied:</p>
<p>Diagram 2: Special Revival Scheme (as followed by one of the insurance
companies)</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Premium_payment_Policy_lapse_and_revival_92.png.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>The terms on revival of the policy: On revival, the policy will date
back for such period, as the lapsed policy was in force subject to the
condition that the date of commencement of the policy on revival does
not fall beyond 2 years from the date of commencement of the original
lapsed policy. The policy will be endorsed for changes in the date of
commencement, age, term, instalment premium, date of last instalment of
premium and maturity date. The revised premium payable would be
calculated for the same term as that of the original policy at the rate
applicable to the age of the life assured as at the new date of
commencement.</p>
<p>The difference between the old premium and the new premium with interest
thereon will have to be paid by the life assured. The life assured will
be required to pay the endorsement fee. The revival consideration, in
monetary terms, is quite low under the special revival scheme, as
arrears of premium are to be paid for only 2 years, part of which will
be the difference between the earlier premium and the new premium. In
simpler words, this scheme is available for those who did not pay the
premium amount for a maximum of 3 successive years only. If this policy
is to be reinforced after two years, the date of policy will be taken 2
years ahead. As such the policy maturity date also will go 2 years
ahead. So the premium amount will be increased a little and the
difference amount along with interest has to be paid.</p>
<p>Instalment Revival Scheme Diagram 3: Instalment Revival Scheme (as
followed by one of the insurers)</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-life/Premium_payment_Policy_lapse_and_revival_93.png.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>The arrears of premiums are calculated in the same manner as under
ordinary revival scheme. Depending upon the mode of payment, the life
assured has to pay initially six monthly premiums, two quarterly
premiums, one half yearly premiums or the half of the yearly premium.
The balance arrears will be spread over the remaining due dates in the
current policy year and two full policy years thereafter. The policy
document will be endorsed suitably.</p>
<p>In other words, in case the policyholder is unable to pay all the unpaid
premiums in lump sum and special revival scheme also doesn't suit him,
he can use this scheme to revive his policy. Under this scheme he can
revive his policy by paying the following amount immediately: Policy can
be reinforced by paying minimum 6 months premium along with the yearly
premium; it means that if the premium is paid yearly, a half of that
premium should be paid extra. If the premium is paid for 6 months, then
same amount of extra premium is to be paid; If it is quarterly premium,
the two quarterly premiums more; If it is monthly premium then an extra
6 months premium should be paid. A suitable interest rate prevalent at
that time will be added to the amount due in this scheme. This shows
that the interest burden will increase with the increase of instalments.
Rest of unpaid premium is to be paid in instalments within two years
along with the regular premium.</p>
<h2 id="loan-cum-revival-scheme-as-followed-by-one-of-the-insurer">Loan cum Revival Scheme (as followed by one of the insurer)</h2>
<p>This scheme involves two functions, viz. granting of loan and revival of the policy
simultaneously. This facility is used by policyholders who would like to
avail of a loan to pay the arrears of premium. This is possible if the
policy has acquired adequate surrender value from which a loan can be
advanced.</p>
<p>The procedure adopted is as follows.</p>
<p>The above schemes of revival are not available with all insurers and if
it does, then it may vary from company to company.</p>
<h2 id="revival-of-postal-life-insurance-policies-pli">Revival of Postal life Insurance Policies (PLI)</h2>
<p>In the case of PLI, Revival of Postal Life
Insurance Policies (PLI) the policy is treated as lapsed if premium is
not paid within 6 months in case of policies which are less than 3 years
old premium is not paid for 12 or more months in the case of policies
are more than 3 years old. Revival procedures are simple. Arrears of
premiums have to be paid with interest at 12% and a certificate of good
health obtained form a Civil Surgeon or an Astt. Civil Surgeon. If
arrears are for more than 6 months in case of a policy which has been
taken less than three years ago or for 11 months in the case of older
policies, the procedures could be a little more elaborate, requiring
references to higher offices.</p>
<p>Question 3 What is it known as when a lapsed policy is made active
again? Policy activation Policy revival Policy survival Policy renewal</p>
<p>Summary Premium is the price paid by the insured for purchasing the
insurance product The rates of premium vary as per age, term and
benefits offered under the type of product Most life insurance companies
use the &lsquo;age nearest birthday&rsquo; method for age determination.</p>
<p>Premiums are normally payable in yearly, half-yearly, quarterly or
monthly instalments An insurance grace period is an extended period of
time a policyholder gets for making their insurance premium payment.
Surrender value is the amount the policyholder will get from the life
insurance company if he decides to exit the policy before maturity
Surrender value or cash value is made available normally when the policy
has remained in force for at least three years The word &lsquo;revival&rsquo; means
&rsquo;to bring back to life&rsquo;. There are various schemes for revival of
insurance policies and the procedures will vary between insurers. The
types of revival schemes followed by the leading insurer are : Ordinary
