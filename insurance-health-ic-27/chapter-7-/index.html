<meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER 7 REGULATORY AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF HEALTH INSURANCE Chapter Introduction Insurance is promise sold to the customer. In order to maintain the trust of people, it is imperative that the insurer honours the promise. A variety of risks such as insurance risk, invesrment risk or liquidity risk endanger the fullfillment of this promise. Self-regulation can protect the insurer against these risks. However an independent regulatory body is needed to add an extra degree of control on the insurance business." />

<h2 id="regulatory-and-legal-aspects-of-health-insurance">REGULATORY AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF HEALTH INSURANCE</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>Insurance is promise sold to the customer. In order
to maintain the trust of people, it is imperative that the insurer
honours the promise. A variety of risks such as insurance risk,
invesrment risk or liquidity risk endanger the fullfillment of this
promise. Self-regulation can protect the insurer against these risks.
However an independent regulatory body is needed to add an extra degree
of control on the insurance business. Also the regulatory authority
needs to have the adequate amount of legal backing in order to do its
job to the best of ability. The chapter discusses the need for health
insurance regulation, the principles of health regulation and various
measures taken to enforce regulation. We also look at health insurance
regulation in the Indian context and the role played by the Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>

<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this Scenario</h2>
<p>Would you buy / renew health insurance if you
noticed the following things? 9 Renewal sometimes rejected on flimsy
grounds 9 Claim settlement takes a long time 9 Premiums are hiked in an
arbitary manner The obvious answer would be &quot;NO&quot;. That leads us to the
next question. How do we prevent the above situations from happening?
The answer lies in regulation. Indian health insurance market is booming
currently and has a lot of issues that need to be taken care of. The
notion of leaving regulation to the &ldquo;good sense&rdquo; of the companies does
not always work. Robust regulations are needed to &ldquo;clean up&rdquo; the grey
areas in health insurance and ensure a greater transparency.</p>
<h2 id="a-principles-and-practice-of-health-insurance-regulation">A. Principles and practice of health insurance regulation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Need for health insurance regulation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>As discussed earlier in Chapter 1, the
health insurance market has several imperfections: 9 9 9 9</p>
<p>Information asymmetry operating at both (insurer&rsquo;s and insured&rsquo;s) end
Risk selection by insurers Adverse selection of insured Moral hazard
present at the demand side (insured) or supply side (health providers)</p>
<p>Regulatory intervention is needed to ensure that the health insurance
market is not adversely affected by these market imperfections. A health
insurance company manages the insurance risk transferred to it through
the insurance contract. However this is not the only uncertainty managed
by it. There are various other types of risks which a health insurer is
required to manage in addition. To ensure that the insurers manage such
risks effectively regulatory oversight is required.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>This section is based on a presentation, Regulating Private Health
Insurance, made in the Flagship course on Health Financing, May 2010, by
Pablo Gottret and Somil Nagpal</p>
<h2 id="2-health-insurance-provider----types-of-risk">2. Health insurance provider &ndash; Types of risk</h2>
<h2 id="a-insurance-risk">a) Insurance risk</h2>
<p>i. Underwriting practices and risk appetite of the insurer give rise to
this type of risk. ii. In health insurance, each risk by itself is not
very large but there still exists the risk of &lsquo;concentration&rsquo;. iii.
Reckless underwriting can create trouble for the insurer. iv.
Reinsurance mitigates this risk, and is discussed in more details in
Chapter 10.</p>
<h2 id="b-investment-risk">b) Investment risk</h2>
<p>i. The occurrence of this type of risk
depends on the mix of investment options chosen by the insurer, as also
the overall environment in the economy. ii. Even if the insurer holds
good quality assets, holding long term debt can lead to liquidity risk.
iii. Complex investment products may be very risky (as can be seen from
what happened with AIG in 2008).</p>
<h2 id="c-credit-risk">c) Credit risk</h2>
<p>i. As in any other
business with financial dealings, there is risk of default by business
associates like providers, suppliers and reinsurers.</p>
<h2 id="d-liquidity-risk">d) Liquidity risk</h2>
<p>i. Even if the insurer is profitable, there can still be a mismatch
between the cash flows, and current assets and liabilities. ii. This
mismatch reduces the insurer&rsquo;s ability to arrange adequate cash to pay
its liabilities at a short notice.</p>
<h2 id="e-business-environment-risk">e) Business environment risk</h2>
<p>i. The insurer may be exposed to changes in the policy environment and the
economic environment which may affect it adversely ii. Operational and
other risks including risk of frauds, risk of not keeping up with
technology, risk of losing key human resources etc. These risks are not
discrete and often overlap and interplay. This requires the top
management to actively manage these risks, along with regulatory
oversight. While self-regulation has been stated as an option, the
incentives to manage risks are different from a regulator&rsquo;s perspective,
thus an independent regulator is more effective.</p>
<h2 id="3-institutional-failures-and-regulations">3. Institutional failures and regulations</h2>
<p>Institutional failures are,
in general, caused by lax management, weak corporate governance, poor
central controls and supervision, unsound accounting systems and other
infrastructure compounded by weaknesses in the legal framework (IAIS,
1997). A study of 21 companies in financial trouble found that
management issues were at the root of the problem (Lorent, 2008 citing
Ashby, McDonnell and Sharma, 2002). Moreover, the complexity of health
insurance business, the multiple risks which health insurers manage, and
the market failures in the sector, all require a very effective top
management role. When the regulator mandates a particular level of
corporate governance, the level of regulatory involvement can decrease.
Mechanisms like independent directors, actuaries, internal auditors etc.
are often required (but that alone too did not work in the case of AIG).
Thus, the complexity of health insurance business makes it very
vulnerable to the effects of poor corporate governance. Regulation
monitors and brings about timely corrective changes to reduce the risk
of institutional failure. Regulation also serves to harmonise the
activities of different players in order to achieve the desired social
objectives from health insurance most notable of which is equitable
access to health. . Health insurance is ultimately a promise, and
regulation is the key to maintaining customer&rsquo;s confidence in the
&lsquo;promise&rsquo; of health insurance.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Why a failed health insurer has major repercussions?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>A health insurer sells a &lsquo;promise&rsquo; to honour a valid
claim, and the consumer&rsquo;s trust in the insurer keeping its promise is
paramount. If an insurer fails, people would lose their confidence in
the entire health insurance system. Also, in health insurance, the
policyholder has long-term expectations for continued coverage. It is
always more difficult to switch insurers as this may entail loss of
benefits. Policyholders who are already ill and in need of ongoing
medical care may lose coverage because of the insurer&rsquo;s failure. New
insurers can decline those who present a higher risk of making claims or
exclude certain conditions and give them poorer coverage than they
already had. Finally, even otherwise, health insurance coverage becomes
more comprehensive due to continuous renewal of insurance, completion of
waiting periods related to the 1-year, 2-year and 4-year exclusions
which stand covered. If a person switches insurers, he may then have to
undergo these waiting periods all over again.</p>
<h2 id="a-regulatory-structure">a) Regulatory structure</h2>
<h2 id="i-statutory-base">i. Statutory base</h2>
<p>The following points are an
important statutory base for the regulator. 9 Legal sanctity for the
regulatory function 9 An independent source of financing 9 Adequate
&rsquo;teeth&rsquo; for the regulator to take penal action</p>
<h2 id="ii-administrative-location">ii. Administrative location</h2>
<p>A health insurance regulator can be housed within a Health
ministry or in an Insurance regulatory agency. In the context of a small
country with limited regulatory manpower, or in the case of regulator
dealing with integrated insurers which also underwrite non-health
businesses, having a health insurance regulator within the overall
insurance regulatory structure is an option. In the case of several
countries, an independent Health Insurance Agency located outside the
health ministry and also outside the regulatory mechanism for non-health
insurance entities is also an option.</p>
<h2 id="iii-licensing-and-registration">iii. Licensing and registration</h2>
<p>These are the regulator&rsquo;s tools to validate the management background,
their integrity, financial strength and business plans before granting
the insurance licence to any entity. These aspects can be important in
ensuring the safety of large amounts of public money which the insurers
will be managing once they have a licence.</p>
<h2 id="iv-financial-regulation">iv. Financial regulation</h2>
<p>Regulators usually lay down prudential accounting regulations and rules,
financial reporting requirements, and undertake constant monitoring of
the financial position of the insurance companies to ensure that they
stay solvent and their accounting statements are true and fair.</p>
<h2 id="v-product-regulation">v. Product regulation</h2>
<p>Regulators lay down filing or approval requirements
for health insurance products. This includes transparency and fairness
requirements to take care of the information asymmetry from the
insurer&rsquo;s side.</p>
<h2 id="vi-price-regulation">vi. Price regulation</h2>
<p>In certain situations, regulator may also regulate
the prices (and increases thereof) of health insurance products.</p>
<h2 id="b-enforcement-of-regulations">b) Enforcement of regulations</h2>
<p>Ensuring enforcement is the essence of health
insurance regulation. All regulations and monitoring systems could be
meaningless without enforcement. Drafting and promulgation of
regulations is not enough, and enforcement is the key to achieving
regulatory objectives. Enforcement begins with careful off-site
monitoring supplemented by on-site visits as necessary. Effective action
for breaches or violations is the key to prevention of such breaches or
violations by the same and other entities. This shows that the regulator
&lsquo;means business&rsquo;. This also serves as a deterrent to similar breaches in
the future. Regulatory actions for breaches or violations can include: 9
9 9 9 9</p>
<p>Restricting business activity or activities by the insurer(s) Levying
fines and penalties on the insurer(s) Ordering removal/ change of
personnel Issuing warnings to the insurer Appointing Liquidator/
Observer/ Administrator, etc.</p>
<h2 id="c-monitoring-by-the-regulators">c) Monitoring by the regulators</h2>
<h2 id="i-offsite-monitoring">i. Offsite monitoring</h2>
<p>This is done at
the regulator&rsquo;s office itself, without actually going to the offices of
the insurance companies. It includes detailed examination of various
documents like 9 9 9 9</p>
<p>MIS Reports, Accounts, Reinsurance contracts, Outsourcing arrangements
etc.</p>
<p>IT systems can play a very important role in offsite monitoring as
several of the processes can be automated and attention of the regulator
can be immediately drawn if any unexpected or adverse information flows
through the system.</p>
<h2 id="ii-onsite-inspections">ii. Onsite inspections</h2>
<p>These are done to verify the reports submitted
by the insurers, check their internal controls, and also examine the
market conduct aspects of the insurers. These are a supplement and not a
substitute of good off-site monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="d-regulation-for-consumer-protection">d) Regulation for consumer protection</h2>
<p>Health insurance has several areas where regulators may need
to ensure that the customer&rsquo;s interests are protected. Some of the
customer protection areas for regulatory intervention include</p>
<h2 id="i-access">i. Access</h2>
<p>Regulators may impose requirements like guaranteed issue or variants
thereof, for some or all products in the market.</p>
<h2 id="ii-renewability-and-cancellation">ii. Renewability and cancellation</h2>
<p>Regulator may lay down certain provisions so that insurers
cannot arbitrarily decline renewals or cancel policies, especially where
they do so with the intention of &lsquo;cream skimming&rsquo;. The possible measures
could include requirements for guaranteed renewability or for certain
disclosures on renewability to be provided upfront to the consumers to
enable them to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>iii. Portability across
insurers, including creditable coverage from earlier insurers, may also
be a regulatory requirement. iv. Product terms and conditions may also
be regulated. There may be requirements like: 9 9 9 9</p>
<p>Standard products or minimum benefit coverage mandates Standardisation
of definitions and terms Caps on waiting periods and cost-sharing
provisions Requirements for fairness, transparency, disclosures</p>
<h2 id="v-prevention-of-miss-selling">v. Prevention of miss-selling</h2>
<p>Prescribing the correct qualifications,
background and market conduct requirements for intermediaries is another
area where regulators lay down the requirements and help prevent
miss-selling and other market conduct issues.</p>
<h2 id="vi-grievance-redressal">vi. Grievance redressal</h2>
<p>Often multiple channels exist for an
aggrieved insurance consumer to take up his grievance with, which can
include 9 Insurer&rsquo;s internal review and grievance mechanism 9
Regulator&rsquo;s review and monitoring mechanisms 9 External reviews or
Ombudsman mechanisms 9 Consumer law, competition laws, company laws 9
Contract law and judicial mechanism Often, regulators take the onus to
co-ordinate amongst these grievance mechanisms, to monitor the data
flowing from grievances and also intervene where necessary. Grievance
redressal is important for consumer&rsquo;s confidence in insurance. The
grievance channels also serve as &lsquo;Eyes and Ears&rsquo; of the regulator to
take action towards the causes of such grievances.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-1">Test Yourself 1</h2>
<p>Which of the following is a risk for an insurer? I.
Insurance risk II. Investment risk III. Liquidity risk IV. All of the
above</p>
<h2 id="b-health-insurance-regulation-in-the-indian-context">B. Health insurance regulation in the Indian context</h2>
<p>Early years of
legislative controls on the insurance sector were consolidated and
updated as the Insurance Act of 1938, which, as revised from time to
time. This does remain at the core of insurance laws for the country30.
The regulatory structure, as also the constituents of the industry,
underwent several changes over the next 7 decades, characterized
particularly by two sets of events which shaped the course of the
industry</p>
<ol>
<li>Nationalisation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Nationalisation of the Life Insurance
industry in 1956 and the Non-life Insurance industry in 1973, wherein
the large number of erstwhile private insurers were nationalised and
merged into one Life Insurance Corporation and one General Insurance
Corporation (the latter with four subsidiary companies) owned by the
Government of India.</p>
<h2 id="2-reforms">2. Reforms</h2>
<p>The &lsquo;Malhotra Committee&rsquo; (1994) submitted a report on
reforms leading to the establishment of the Insurance Regulator &ndash; the
interim regulator- Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) in 1996. The
statutory authority, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority
(IRDA) was established in 2000. The Indian insurance industry is, thus,
governed by Insurance Act, 1938, General Insurance Business
(Nationalisation) Act, 1972, Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, and
IRDA Act 1999.</p>

<p>IRDA is not just a regulatory authority
but also plays an active &lsquo;development&rsquo; role in health insurance, which
has been established in the preamble of IRDA Act, section 14 of IRDA Act
and Section 3(2AA) of Insurance Act 1938. As health insurance in India
continues to be in its early stages, the role of IRDA is also very
crucial in preventing adverse consequences of the health insurance for
cost of care, equity, consumer satisfaction, fraud and ethical
standards. IRDA has stipulated several regulations for both life and
non-life insurance companies in many aspects of business and the same
are also applicable, where relevant, in case of health insurance. Let us
look at the role of the Regulator in different aspects</p>
<h2 id="a-policyholders-protection-regulation-and-grievance-redressal">a) Policyholder&rsquo;s protection regulation and grievance redressal</h2>
<p>In the General Insurance
industry, the Regulator plays a vital role in the protection of
interests of the stakeholders, including policyholders, insurers,
insurance intermediaries etc. Insurance business being a contract of
Uberrima Fidei or Utmost Good Faith, Insurance Regulatory and
Development Authority (IRDA) facilitates transparency and fair business
practices in the Indian Insurance industry through certain guidelines
for both insurers and insured which aims to establish a healthy business
environment. As part of its role as the apex body that governs the
manner in which business is conducted in the insurance industry, IRDA
has formed Policyholder Protection Regulations, 2002 with a view to
safeguarding the interests of policyholders at large. The Policyholder
Protection regulations, 2002 comprises a set of guidelines for insurers
encompassing areas of point of sale, proposal form, grievance redressal,
policy details, claims process and policy servicing.</p>
<p>These guidelines cover the entire policy lifecycle, allowing the insured
to make an informed buying decision and avail of the policy benefits.
The act mandates insurers to provide sufficient information to prospects
regarding the aforementioned areas. The IRDA has a Grievance Redressal
Cell which plays a facilitative role by taking up complaints against
insurers with the respective companies for speedy resolution. The IRDA
however does not adjudicate on complaints. As claims/policy contracts in
dispute require adjudication and the IRDA does not carry out any
adjudication, insured are advised to approach the available
quasi-judicial or judicial channels, i.e., the Insurance Ombudsmen,
Consumer fora or the Civil courts for such complaints.</p>
<h2 id="b-access-to-health-insurance-for-senior-citizens-and-ruralinformal-sector-workers">b) Access to health insurance for senior citizens and rural/informal sector workers</h2>
<p>IRDA act empowers it to issue regulations to the insurance company to
cater to the needs of weaker and vulnerable section of population in
specified manner. IRDA has laid down certain instructions for providing
access to senior citizens in 2009. It has also prescribed obligations
under rural &amp; social sector which encourage insurers for making products
specifically for health insurance under micro insurance regulations.</p>
<h2 id="c-role-of-irda-in-standardisation-initiatives">c) Role of IRDA in standardisation initiatives</h2>
<p>IRDA has supported and
actively participated in the pioneering initiatives through
multi-stakeholder industry group, which worked together in addressing
issues which concern health insurance. This has been discussed in an
earlier chapter. In brief, these included Standard Treatment Guidelines
(STGs) for 21 common causes of hospitalisation, standard definitions of
critical illness enhancing the customer&rsquo;s understanding of these terms
and easier comparison of product offerings in the market, standardising
the list of non-medical expenses smoothening the interaction between the
patients, hospitals, TPAs, and insurers by minimizing ambiguities on
what is payable under health insurance policies, standardization of
important documents in health insurance system, like pre-authorization
form and the claim form etc. The initiatives have culminated in
guidelines on &ldquo;Standardization in Health Insurance&rdquo; issued in Feb 2013
by IRDA. Refer Annexure at the end of study material for detailed
guidelines. These would help boost operational efficiency in the system
as also yield data for industry&rsquo;s development.</p>
<h2 id="d-pre-existing-diseases-peds">d) Pre Existing diseases (PEDs)</h2>
<p>It is estimated that an overwhelming
majority of claim disputes in non- life sector are related to medical
(health) insurance and majority of these pertains to pre-existing
diseases. This prompted the General Insurance Council to arrive at a
standard definition for PEDs in 2008.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>For all the medical expenses (indemnity) products Pre exiting
diseases will be &ldquo;Any condition, ailment or injury or related
conditions(s) for which insured had signs or symptoms, and/or were
diagnosed, and/ or received medical advice/ treatment, within 48 months
prior to insured&rsquo;s first policy with the insurer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="ped-exclusion-wordings">PED exclusion wordings</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Benefits will not be available for any condition(s) as defined
in the policy, until 48 months of continuous coverage have elapsed,
since inception of the first policy with any insurer.&rdquo; The essence of
this definition is that it provides a maximum look back period of 48
months and a maximum waiting period of covering pre-existing diseases as
48 months. Insurance companies are at liberty to reduce these periods
but not enhance it.</p>
<h2 id="e-renewability-of-health-insurance-policies">e) Renewability of health insurance policies</h2>
<p>Regulator in consultation with the industry came up with landmark
circulars on renewability of health insurance policies which has many
provisions and lay emphasis on adequate disclosures, and promoting
transparency and fair treatment for policyholders. These circulars
helped in enhancing policyholder&rsquo;s confidence in the health insurance
system.</p>

<p>As per the IRDA definition, what is the maximum waiting
period for covering pre-existing diseases? I. 1 year II. 24 months III.
