<p>To play any game, knowing the rules of the game
are very critical. Also it enables the player or observer of the game to
appreciate the rules, respect its sanctity, enjoy the game in a better
manner, pass critique on the method of play like an expert, appreciate
the facts, involve himself for the improvement of the game and also
ensure that a rule of one game is not mixed up with another without
proper judgment. For example, one cannot apply the rules of tennis in
cricket and play cricket with a tennis bat. However, when children do
play cricket matches with a cricket bat and tennis ball, even though a
slight deviation is applied, still the philosophy of cricket is not
tarnished but it allows many more to participate without fearing any
wounds which a cricket ball may cause. Similarly, the set of rules for
health insurance policies are the forms and clauses, and this chapter
covers the same. Some questions which this chapter aims to answer
include a) b) c) d)</p>
<p>What forms the basis of health insurance? Why are so many questions
asked during the purchase of health insurance policies? What are the
common clauses that are applicable for health insurance? What is the
need for common definitions and initiatives taken on that front?</p>
<h2 id="a-health-insurance-contract">A. Health insurance contract</h2>
<ol>
<li>Health insurance contract</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Health insurance policy is actually a contract between the insurer and the
insured. The word contract is derived from the word &lsquo;Contrahere&rsquo;- which
means &rsquo;to draw together&rsquo; and it stresses the importance of mutuality in
the use of the particle or subject, more than the word &lsquo;Agreement&rsquo;.
That&rsquo;s why insurance policies are popularly known as insurance contracts
rather than insurance agreements wherein the mutuality of both the
parties are stressed based on the principles of &lsquo;Uberima Fides&rsquo; viz.
Utmost Good Faith not only at the time of initiation of the contract but
also at the time of execution or termination of contract.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Webster dictionary defines contract as &ldquo;a binding agreement
between two or more persons or parties; especially: one legally
enforceable&rdquo;. A contract is supposed to have mandatory elements like: a)
b) c) d) 80</p>

<p>Diagram 1: Mandatory elements of a contract</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Health_Insurance_Policy_forms_and_Clauses_51.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Insurance contracts are based on the product features offered by the
insurance company. The product mentions the benefits offered in the
event of any loss or the happening of the insured event, specific terms
and conditions governing the product, consideration (premium) and other
inputs in the form of declarations expected from the insured etc.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>A health insurance contract is based on the principles of
contract law and the provisions of the insurance contract. It has all
the mandatory elements of a contract.</p>
<p>a)Offer and acceptance: Health insurance policies offer the benefits of
providing coverage in the event of hospitalisation/ illness for a
premium that is required to be paid by the customer.</p>
<p>b)Consideration: The extent of premium is determined by the inputs &amp;
declarations provided by the customer about their age, health status
etc.</p>
<p>c) Capacity of contract: Both the parties, insurer and insured should be
legally capable of entering into a health insurance contract.</p>
<p>d)Legality of form: When a customer buys a health insurance policy; it
means that he is signing a contract with the insurance company to cover
his illness based on a mutual consent.</p>
<p>The mutual consent comes in the form of the proposal by the customer and
its acceptance by the insurer.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Insurance contract vs. other contracts</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>One may wonder why in the case of insurance, the customer normally does
not have much say other than accepting most of the conditions of the
product. Sometimes the conditions are written in difficult legal
language that it may be very difficult for a person to understand as
well. As insurers cover the risk based on the laws of probability, law
of large numbers and other principles of insurance, the insurance
company contracts are slightly different from the other contracts.
In general, insurance contracts are different from the other contracts
through the following ways:</p>
<p>a)Unlike other contracts, the customer may never see the copy of the
contract till he receives the policy (though ideally it should not
differ much from the content of the prospectus which the customer should
see beforehand).</p>
<p>b)While in other forms of contracts, the buyer should beware &lsquo;caveat
emptor&rsquo;; however this rule stands modified in insurance contracts by the
principle of &lsquo;utmost good faith&rsquo; from both the sides.</p>

<p>Health insurance is ___________ between the
insurer and the insured. I. An agreement II. A contract III. A deal IV.
A mutual consent</p>
<h2 id="b-health-insurance-proposal-form">B. Health insurance proposal form</h2>
<p>The proposal form of any health
insurance application form can be segregated into two main parts: 9
Details of the applicant 9 Declaration by the applicant As mentioned
earlier, the details provided in the proposal form, build the basis for
an insurance contract and the applicant is expected to provide the same
with &lsquo;utmost good faith&rsquo;. The details given provide the basis for the
underwriting of the proposal and the acceptance of the risk by the
insurer.</p>
<ol>
<li>Details of the applicant</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The applicant details section
usually covers the following minimum questions:</p>
<p>a) Name of the applicant with father&rsquo;s/husband&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>b) Date of birth</p>
<p>c)Sex</p>
<p>d) Age (in completed years)</p>
<p>e)Occupation</p>
<p>f) Sum insured/ plan opted for</p>
<p>g) Address &amp; telephone number</p>
<p>h) PAN details</p>
<p>i) Details of the hospitalisation/illness/disease at present or in the
past/ last 4 years</p>
<p>j)</p>
<p>If it is a family floater policy, then the details of the members with
their relationship will also be asked.</p>
<p>Many people think that why insurers ask for more information than
required for a bank account, or for a new mobile phone connection? The
underlying principle is that the data becomes more vital in case of
health insurance as it forms part of the underwriting process and also
the &lsquo;insurance contract&rsquo; wherein in other cases; it is just a
requirement to register the details of the customer under Know Your
Customer (KYC) norms. A person is likely to know more things about
himself when compared to others, which is part of the information
asymmetry of health insurance from the insured&rsquo;s side. The insurance
company is entering into an insurance contract to protect his health
related risks by trusting his statements in the proposal, which is
assumed to be given on the basis of &lsquo;Utmost Good Faith&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Health related risks can be judged to some extent on the basis of
insured&rsquo;s age, occupation, place of residence etc. Based on the past
data also, it is assumed that human beings are prone to more diseases
when they grow older. Hence age becomes a very important factor while
calculating the premium. That&rsquo;s why the standard premium tables of an
insurance company are classified on the basis of age.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>The proposal form requires an applicant to fill up the details
of his current occupation. By knowing the occupation of the customer, an
insurance company is in a better position to forecast any of the
occupational hazards. For example, drivers are at a high risk of
accidents, persons working in chemical factories may be at a high risk
of respiratory diseases. Similarly, the proposal form also requires the
customer to fill up the details of his current diseases and the
treatment undergone in the recent past, say last four years at least.
This will enable the insurance company to understand the health status
better. It does not mean that the health insurance companies insure only
healthy individuals or there are always customers who have undergone
treatment in the past. The information provided in the form will help
the insurance company to estimate the severity of the diseases, scope of
the treatment in future, incidence of such treatments that may
occur/reoccur in the near future, approximate cost of such treatments
etc. The details of the family members are asked in case of a family
policy or a family floater policy. The family floater policy is
typically a single sum insured within which the whole family is covered.
In other words, the sum insured is shared amongst the members of the
family instead of each member having separate coverage limits. The
floater policy usually covers only the immediate family of the primary
insured person and not distant relatives. Hence, the relationships are
also captured along with the health details of the members. Even for the
individual insurance, family health data helps the insurer to understand
any hereditary diseases in the family. Insurers also insist for medical
examination of the insured if the age of the insured is beyond a
particular age, say 45 years or 50 years. Moreover if any specific
health condition has been described in the proposal form by the
proposer, the insurer may, as a part of the underwriting process, can
ask for a detailed medical examination irrespective of the age of the
proposer.</p>
<h2 id="2-self-declaration-of-health-status-by-the-applicant">2. Self-declaration of health status by the applicant</h2>
<p>Self-declaration
of health status includes specific questions about any illnesses in
various systems of the human body. The following is only an indicative
list and may vary from one insurance company to another. a) b) c) d) e)
f) g) h) i) j) k) l) m) n) o) p)</p>
<p>Neurological diseases Mental diseases Paralysis Fainting
episodes/blackouts High blood pressure Heart diseases including ischemic
heart disease Circulatory disorders Diseases pertaining to uterus,
ovaries etc. (for women) Fistula, Piles Ophthalmological diseases like
Cataract Respiratory diseases Allergic diseases Diabetes Cancer Cerebral
diseases like paralytic strokes etc. Tuberculosis, AIDS, HIV etc.</p>
<p>The reason for asking so many questions instead of a simple question
about an individual&rsquo;s overall health for a health insurance is to: i.
Record the facts in detail which forms basis of the contract. ii. To
enable the customer to think through various diseases so that he can
provides the necessary information iii. Arrange for further medical
examination if any needed to estimate the severity of the disease etc.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Comparisons of health insurance questionnaires with personal accident
insurance, life insurance and group insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>For individual policies,
health insurance questionnaires may look somewhat similar when compared
with the proposal forms used for life insurance &amp; personal accident
insurance. Though, the weightage for different underwriting factors may
vary. However in group insurance (whether it is for life or health),
there are usually no specific health questions recorded from the
individual member of the group, rather, the risk and the premiums are
determined on the basis of the claims experience and the nature of the
group.</p>
<p>The group is insured based on the master policy contract entered between
the insurance company and the group organiser (which can be an
employeremployee group or an affinity group) based on the details of the
members provided. Some of the details that are usually recorded are: a)
b) c) d) e) f)</p>
<p>Nature of the group Number of members Age group of members Income
details Nature of work Geographical spread etc.</p>

<h2 id="c-policy-clauses-for-various-health-insurance-products">C. Policy clauses for various health insurance products</h2>
<ol>
<li>Hospitalisation indemnity plans</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>This product is offered on individual as
well as on group basis. Typically this policy will reimburse the
following benefits:</p>
<p>a) Hospital costs: 9 Accommodation costs, nursing care, operation theatre
expenses 9 Specialist consultations and physiotherapy received as
in-patient</p>
<p>b) Specialist fees: 9 Surgeon&rsquo;s and anaesthetist&rsquo;s fee for in-patient and
day care operations 9 Physician&rsquo;s fee for in-patient treatment 9 Cost of
medicines, diagnostics tests etc.</p>
<p>Pre-existing conditions (conditions the insured had before taking out
the insurance) are usually excluded from coverage for a defined period
(In 2008, the General Insurance Council decided to cap the waiting
period for preexisting conditions to 4 years which is discussed later in
this course). c)</p>
<p>These products generally exclude the following: 9 9 9 9 9 9 9</p>
<p>Drug abuse Self-inflicted injuries Out-patient treatment HIV/AIDS of
sexually transmitted diseases Cosmetic surgery (unlinked to burns or
cancer) Preventive treatment/ immunisations etc. Maternity and
termination of pregnancy</p>
<p>Usually, the condition for eligibility for this benefit payment is that
the insured has to be hospitalised for at least 24 hours. This is,
however, waived for certain defined day-care surgical procedures where
due to technological advancement, the patient can undergo surgery and be
discharged on the same day (which earlier would have taken a much longer
period of hospitalisation). Some insurers operate no-claim discount (or
no claim bonus) scales for their individual policyholders or offer
health check benefits for claim-free policies.</p>
<p>I</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>Rakesh had taken a health insurance plan in the year 2010 with
coverage of Rs. 1 lakh in the event of hospitalisation. There were few
clauses in his health insurance contract for no claim bonus which he has
not paid attention at that time. He came to know about these clauses
after completion of the first year which pleasantly surprised him. His
first year of the policy was a claim free year, i.e. he had made no
hospitalisation claims from his insurance company. So, the insurance
company has increased his basic sum insured by 10%, i.e. Rs.10,000 as a
claim free bonus in the next year which increases his total coverage to
Rs.110,000. His next year again was a claim free year; therefore as a
bonus, company provided him with a free health checkup and also
increased his basic sum insured, i.e. increasing his coverage up to
Rs.1.2 lakhs. Recently, these products have seen the introduction of
many cost sharing provisions like: i. Sub-limits on specific components
of the hospital costs ii. Co-payments (also called &lsquo;co-insurance&rsquo;) where
a defined share of the costs are borne by the insured and iii.
Deductibles (also called &rsquo;excess&rsquo;) where the initial defined amount of
hospital costs are borne by the policyholder after which the coverage
starts. These help to reduce moral hazard, and contribute to lower
overall costs for the insurer, which also means that the reduced insurer
liability can flow to the customer in the form of reduced premium.

<h2 id="2-critical-illness-policy">2. Critical illness policy</h2>
<p>Thanks to medical advances, more and more
people are surviving major diseases like cancer, strokes, and heart
attacks etc. Medical care has increased life expectancy resulting in
people surviving critical illnesses that would have previously resulted
in death. This, however, continues to require high amount of medical
costs, reduced ability to work and a major change in lifestyle. Thus,
the financial security of the individual and his family is severely
threatened when a person is diagnosed with a critical illness. The
critical illness policy eases the financial pressure by providing a lump
sum payment on diagnosis of a covered condition (or on undergoing a
covered procedure). The proceeds are a cash benefit and thus can be used
by the insured for any purpose. In the Indian context, life insurance
companies offer this product in two forms: a) Accelerated CI benefit
product, as a rider to a life insurance policy b) Stand-alone CI product
(also offered now by many non-life and standalone health insurers) In
the accelerated CI product, the death benefit is accelerated and the
benefit amount (otherwise payable on death) is paid if the insured is
diagnosed of any specified critical illnesses. Under the second type,
the benefit is payable on diagnosis of critical illness and is unlinked
to any death benefit.</p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example</h2>
<p>Raghav had taken a life insurance policy for Rs.3 lakhs which
included an accelerated critical illness cover of Rs.1 lakh at the age
of 25. He was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 36 which was covered
under his critical illness policy. So, the insurance company paid him
Rs.1 lakh on diagnosis of cancer and his life insurance coverage was
reduced to Rs.2 lakhs (Rs.3 lakhs &ndash; Rs.1 lakh). He died at the age of
45 and the insurance company paid the remaining life insurance cover of
Rs. 2 lakhs to his beneficiaries. However, if Raghav would have taken a
stand alone critical illness policy of Rs.1 lakh along with the life
insurance coverage of Rs.3 lakhs, then he could have received Rs.1 lakh
on the diagnosis of cancer disease and at the time of his death, his
beneficiaries could have received the entire life insurance sum of Rs.3
lakhs. i. The list of covered critical illnesses in any product varies
across insurers and insurers often design products based on the
following factors: 9 It is a condition perceived to be serious by
potential customers, incurs high cost and can hamper their lifestyle. 9
Each condition covered can be defined clearly especially in terms of its
&lsquo;payout point&rsquo; at which the benefit amount becomes payable. 9 Sufficient
data is available to price the product.</p>
<p>The last mentioned data may not be easy to find in India but currently
Indian insurers are pricing the products based on reinsurers&rsquo; data.
Initiatives have also been underway to standardise the nomenclature and
definitions of critical illnesses in India so that the products are
comparable and can be more readily understood by the potential
customers. In many markets (UK, Malaysia etc) the definitions of the
conditions are already standardised by industry agreement or regulatory
action. In India also, IRDA has moved forward in this direction in
consultation with the industry. ii. Common conditions which are covered
in critical illness policies are: 9 9 9 9 9 9</p>
<p>Cancer Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) Heart attack/ Myocardial
infarction Kidney failure Major organ transplant Stroke</p>
<p>iii. Some other common conditions which are additionally offered in CI
policies nowadays are: 9 9 9 9 9 9</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease Multiple sclerosis Aorta surgery Benign brain tumor
Motor neuron disease Paralysis/Paraplegia</p>
<h2 id="3-other-benefit-products">3. Other benefit products</h2>
<p>Benefit products are increasingly being
offered by insurance companies actively in the Indian health space,
which offer lump sum payouts irrespective of the expenses incurred. Some
examples include the following:</p>
<p>a)</p>
<p>Hospitalisation daily cash allowance: or its variants allowing higher
cash allowance for accidents or ICU stay (benefit of Rs.X in addition)</p>
<p>b)</p>
<p>Convalescence or recuperation benefit: in case of continuous
hospitalisation for more than X days at a stretch, the policy provides a
lump sum cash benefit.</p>
<p>c)</p>
<p>Surgical benefit: provides pre-determined cash benefit for undergoing
the covered surgeries, though regardless of actual expenditures.</p>
<p>d)</p>
<p>Personal accident benefit and disability benefit</p>
<p>None of the reimbursement or indemnity health insurance policies meet
100 per cent of the expenses incurred due to a hospitalisation. For
instance, the expenses on attendant&rsquo;s food, visitor charges, etc., are
not covered by the policies. The customer will be out of office during
hospitalisation and there are chances that he will incur loss of pay.
The allowances are expected to offset his loss of income and other such
incidental costs. The principle of &lsquo;contribution&rsquo; is only applicable to
indemnity policies and not to the benefit type covers. Thus, a person
may hold two policies of benefit type from two different companies, and
his payable amount from each insurer does not get reduced, rather the
two will get added.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Disability benefit plans or income protection plans</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Disability benefit plans are also known as income protection plans
(IP). This product protects and covers the loss of income when the
insured is unable to pursue his occupation due to injury or illness.
Such products can be designed with different structure of benefit
payments. The benefit i.e., income payment during the period of
incapacity can be level or increasing. Nowadays many insurers are
offering increasing level of benefit payment to suit the increasing
level of salary or inflation. The benefit escalation may come with
increased premium or level premium throughout the policy term.</p>
<h2 id="example-4">Example</h2>
<p>As we all know that life is uncertain, a person who is earning
good and living happily with his family can instantly lose his ability
to earn income due to a sudden accident or illness. A normal health
insurance policy can help a person to pay his medical bills, but it
would not help him to replace his income which he lost due to not
attending his job. A disability benefit plan can help in such condition
by providing income to a person when he is unable to work due to
accident or illness to meet his daily expenses. In India, this product
is currently available only as a component of comprehensive personal
accident policies from some of the non-life insurers or is available
from life insurers as a rider to life insurance products, called as
&ldquo;Accident and disability benefit rider&rdquo;. In either case, this provides
for a fixed income (related to the sum assured under the insurance
policy) during the period of incapacity due to accident (but not due to
ill health) subject to a maximum payout period as laid down in the
policy. Illness related IP covers are yet to find their way in the
Indian market.</p>
<h2 id="5-long-term-care-plan">5. Long term care plan</h2>
<p>Long-term care includes all forms of continuing
personal or nursing care for people who are unable to look after
themselves without a degree of support and whose health is not likely to
get better in future. The long-term care costs can be divided into three
broad categories. a) b) c)</p>
<p>Personal care costs like the additional costs incurred for being looked
after by nurses or skilled personnel Living costs like food, clothing,
amenities etc Housing costs</p>
<p>LTC insurance has evolved with an aim to indemnify the insured for the
additional costs incurred when they are in need of long-term care. It is
a new concept and is still evolving in developed markets. LTCI plans can
be classified based on method of funding.</p>
<h2 id="a-pre-funded-plans">a) Pre-funded plans</h2>
<p>Under these plans, the insured will pay the premium when the insured is
in healthy condition. The premium payment can be for a certain period or
for life time. The benefit payment is dependent on claim definition. The
claim trigger may be defined based upon impact on Activities of Daily
Living (ADL&rsquo;s) or more restrictive definitions can be used. The more
restrictive the definition, the lesser will be the premium as there will
be less likelihood of incidence of claim.</p>
<p>b) Immediate needs plans</p>
<p>These plans are purchased by a lump sum payment when the insured is
requiring long term care. The severity of disability will decide the
quantum of benefit. The more is the disability, the more will be the
benefit as the expected survival period requiring long-term care will be
lesser. This product concept is relatively new. The market for this
product is developing rapidly in developed markets. In India the market
for this product (at the time of writing this course) is yet to be
developed. However, with development of nuclear families, changing
culture, and developing economy the product will find market in the
coming years.</p>
<h2 id="6-health-savings-or-investments-linked-plans">6. Health savings or investments linked plans</h2>
<p>Health insurance in India
is largely a pure risk product without any investment returns. Recently,
some life insurance companies have launched Unit Linked Health Insurance
plans. In this plan, the total premium is split up into risk premium and
investment amount. While the risk premium is allocated for the health
insurance coverage, the investment amount is diverted to the unit linked
funds which can pay for the future health costs or for the costs like
OPD not covered in the risk component. The products may also offer other
benefits like hospitalisation allowances, critical illness benefits etc.
Internationally, there are products called as Health Savings Account
(HSA) which accumulate an amount to be utilised when the account holder
needs to spend on health care, i.e. usually at the senior age. These
products encourage savings for expected high costs of medical care in
the future. Individuals are personally conscious of costs so help reduce
moral hazard and may mobilise greater funds for health. However, savings
alone are generally not high enough to protect a person from
unexpectedly high cost diseases or chronic conditions. To avoid this,
HSA&rsquo;s are often offered together with a catastrophic health insurance
plan to cover rare but high cost events. 7. Group insurance schemes
Group insurance is the most common form of health insurance globally.
Group insurance reduces adverse selection and offers the customer the
advantage of collective bargaining power with respect to the features of
the product, premium discounts etc. The critical factors to be
considered while issuing a group policy are:</p>
<p>a) The group should be an already existing one and must not have been
formed for the purpose of insurance coverage.</p>
<p>b) There should be a minimum number of members in the group (according to
insurer&rsquo;s requirements)</p>
<p>c)</p>
<p>There should be a group organiser who can act as a coordinator with the
insurance company.</p>
<p>Group insurance policies can be issued to various types of groups like
employeremployee groups and affinity groups. Again, the premium
contribution can be either contributory or non-contributory schemes. In
contributory schemes, the beneficiaries (employees or members) also
contribute to the premium and in non-contributory schemes, only the
employer or the affinity organisation contributes to the premium.
Normally, employee premiums are paid by the employers for availing the
corporate tax benefits and it also serves as an attractive feature for
recruiting the people from the market and for retaining them.</p>
<h2 id="example-5">Example</h2>
<p>Group insurance is also available to groups other than the
employer-employee groups but they should not be formed solely with a
purpose of taking advantage of insurance coverage. For example, a credit
card company can offer health insurance coverage plan to its members as
an add-on benefit. The amount of coverage in such groups is decided on
the basis of certain criteria, which can be age, years of membership in
the group or the income of the members. In case the coverage is based on
the income of the members such as farmer&rsquo;s society or milkman&rsquo;s society,
then it can be fixed as a fixed multiple of the income of each member of
the group.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Difference between group and individual policies</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>There are
some key differences between the group and individual policies which are
summarised below:</p>
<h2 id="a-product">a) Product</h2>
<p>Individual plans usually have standard
terms and conditions whereas group insurance policies are usually
customised or tailor made and the terms and conditions can be fine-tuned
according to the nature of the group. For example, the group policies
may cover maternity and pre-existing diseases from day one.</p>
<h2 id="b-premium">b) Premium</h2>
<p>The premium for the individual products can vary from the group
insurance. During the tariff era, where premium for fire and engineering
insurance was fixed by tariff, insurance companies experienced very low
claims ratio in fire portfolio and used to cross-subsidise the group
health insurance premium as a marketing strategy for fire business. This
led to a very high claims ratio in health insurance portfolio. However,
after detariffing, there has been a gradual correction in group health
insurance premium. In fact, increasingly the true costs of group health
insurance are becoming apparent to corporate consumers and they are
exploring ways to reduce the costs of insurance coverage for their
employees/members, including cost sharing mechanisms like deductibles,
introducing contribution of premium from employees to cover their
dependant parents etc.</p>
<h2 id="c-medical-records">c) Medical records</h2>
<p>When purchasing an individual
health insurance policy, a person has to usually answer a health
questionnaire and undergo lots of medical examinations. An insurance
company can accept, deny or add some limitations while providing
coverage on the basis of such data.</p>
<p>However, most of the group health plans are provided without any medical
examination or records. This is because insurer is pooling the risk by
covering large number of people, which helps to maintain balance between
people with poor health and those with good health.</p>
<h2 id="d-underwriting">d) Underwriting</h2>
<p>In group health insurance, every person in the group is included in the
plan and no one can be denied coverage on the basis of any pre-existing
health conditions. But in an individual health insurance plan, insurer
has an option to choose or deny the coverage on the basis of
pre-existing health conditions. Table 5.1 Difference between individual
and group health insurance Individual health Group health insurance

<h2 id="d-common-clauses-in-all-health-insurance-products">D. Common clauses in all health insurance products</h2>
<p>Based on the health
insurance products currently available in India, some of the common
insurance clauses are discussed in this Learning Outcome. Any of these
clauses may be modified and/or adapted by insurance companies according
to their requirements and so this section should be seen only as a
general listing to help understand health insurance product conditions.
However, an inquisitive student can read in detail about the various
definitions and other health insurance clauses used for health insurance
products on insurer&rsquo;s websites.</p>
<ol>
<li>24 hours hospitalisation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Expenses on
hospitalisation are generally admissible only if the same is for a
minimum period of 24 hours. However, there is an exception for cases of
specialised treatment which can now be undertaken in a shorter time
(less than 24 hours) due to technological advances called day care
procedures. It usually includes hemodialysis, chemotherapy, eye surgery,
D&amp;C, angioplasty, hernia, hydrocele, surgery related to ENT etc. (this
list is only indicative).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Limits of usage</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>a) Hospitals where
treatment under insurance cover is taken: i. Should be duly licensed and
registered ii. Should be under the supervision of a registered medical
practitioner, and iii. Should have the prescribed minimum number of
in-patient medical beds e.g. minimum 15 for Metros &amp; larger cities, and
10 beds in smaller towns etc. Such conditions ensure that the treatment
is provided at a standard and established place and scope for frauds is
reduced.
b) Room rent: Often, to balance the costs of medical necessity
and luxury, as also to control costs for insurers, some limits for room
charges are imposed, say 1% of sum insured etc.</p>
<h2 id="example-6">Example</h2>
<p>Swati has taken a health insurance policy with a cover of Rs.1
lakh recently which has a clause for limits on usage of some
hospitalisation expenses such as: 9 9 9 9 9</p>
<p>Room rent limit: 1% of the sum insured ICU charges: 2% of the sum
insured subject to maximum of Rs.10,000 Doctor&rsquo;s fees: 3% of the sum
insured Cataract operation: Rs.20,000 per eye Angioplasty: Rs.60,000</p>
<h2 id="3-limits-of-indemnity">3. Limits of indemnity</h2>
<p>It is the maximum liability for any or all of
the claims made during the policy period. It can be availed during the
period of the policy by the insured person for hospitalisation or any
other claimable events. This is stated on the policy schedule and is
also called the sum insured.</p>
<h2 id="example-7">Example</h2>
<p>Karan had taken a mediclaim policy for a cover of Rs.2 lakhs.
Unluckily, it was a very bad year for Karan health-wise. He met with an
accident and had a few fractures in his body. He had to undergo surgery
for it and was later hospitalised for 15 days for recovery. The bill
raised by the hospital was Rs.185,000 which was paid by his insurance
company. He left with a coverage of Rs.15,000. Few months later, he was
again hospitalised due to a heart attack and the bill raised by the
hospital this time was Rs.25,000. As his balance indemnity limit was
only Rs.15,000, the insurance company paid that amount and the balance
amount of Rs.10,000 had to be paid by Karan from his pocket.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Domiciliary hospitalisation benefit</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>This benefit was previously offered
in mediclaim products and now is also included in some of the newer
hospitalisation policies. It implies medical treatment for a period
exceeding three days for such illness which in normal course would
require care and treatment at a hospital/nursing home as inpatient but
actually taken whilst confined at home in India due to any of the
following circumstances:</p>
<p>a) The condition of the patient is such that he/she cannot be moved to the
hospital/nursing home, or</p>
<p>b) The patient cannot be moved to the hospital due to lack of any place in
the hospital.</p>
<h2 id="example-8">Example</h2>
<p>Puneet got caught by swine flu spreading widely in his city. All
the hospitals in the city were mostly occupied by such patients, so he
didn&rsquo;t get a bed in any of the hospitals. His condition started
deteriorating, so the doctors suggested his family to start the
treatment at home by making arrangements for all the necessary set-ups
of a hospital at his home. The treatment continued for six days.
Puneet&rsquo;s health insurance coverage had a clause for coverage of
domiciliary hospitalisation costs which fully covered all his expenses
during this treatment.</p>
<h2 id="5-cashless-hospitalisation-procedure">5. Cashless hospitalisation procedure</h2>
<p>Cashless is a facility offered to
the health insurance customers through insurers&rsquo; in-house channels or
through Third Party Administrators (TPA) who coordinate with the
customer and the hospital to ensure that the admissible bills are not
required to be paid in the hospital by the customer and are directly
settled by the TPA/insurer in due course. Admission should be in a
listed hospital which is in the empanelment list of the insurer/TPA
(network hospital) and is subject to the pre-authorisation being granted
by the insurer/TPA. The TPAs will validate the incidence reported by the
claimant and after satisfaction, will issue a pre-authorisation letter
to the hospital guaranteeing the payment. The TPA may not necessarily
approve all the claims and may require more information or documents.
Denial of cashless does not affect the admissibility of claims and the
customers can submit the claim papers later to the insurer/TPA for
reimbursement.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Deductible</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Deductibles are a cost sharing mechanism.
These are the initial amount of an admissible claim which must be first
borne by the insured before the insurer starts paying for the claim.</p>
<h2 id="example-9">Example</h2>
<p>Girish has taken a health insurance policy which had a clause
for deductible of Rs.10,000. This clause means that the first Rs.10,000
of every admissible claim will have to be borne by Girish and excess, if
any will be paid by the insurance company. For example, if Girish has
incurred hospitalisation expenses of Rs.25,000, then he will have to pay
first Rs.10,000 from his own pocket as deductible and then the insurance
company will pay excess sum of Rs.15,000.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Co-payment or co-insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>In the Indian context, both of these terms are used interchangeably to
reflect the percentage of risk that the insured is required to bear.</p>
<h2 id="example-10">Example</h2>
<p>The health insurance policy taken by Vikas has a co-payment
clause of 20%. It means that the insurance company will not bear the
entire expenses. Vikas will have to pay Rs.20 from his own pocket for
every Rs.100 claimed. Therefore, if Vikas will incur hospitalisation
expenses of Rs.15,000, then he will have to pay 20% of it, i.e. Rs.3,000
from his own pocket and the insurance company will pay his share of 80%,
i.e. remaining expenses of Rs.12,000.</p>
<h2 id="8-waiting-period">8. Waiting period</h2>
<p>The initial period within which any claims made will
not be entertained. Normally, all the new policies come with a minimum
30 days waiting period wherein the insured person cannot make a claim
for the diseases contracted during the first 30 days. This is to avoid
someone taking a policy in order to get a hospitalisation claim
immediately after purchase of the policy. The waiting period does not
usually apply to accidental injuries, or to renewals of policies.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Pre-existing illness</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>This gains importance in the light of the exclusion
to the policy that is applicable for the pre-existing illnesses. This
has been the subject of many legal interpretations, a lot of consumer
grievances and considerable media attention. In recent years, subsequent
to a consensus of the General Insurance Council, insurance companies
have started covering pre-existing illness after the completion of 4
policy years. An insurance company may choose to reduce 4 year period
but cannot increase the same..</p>
<h2 id="example-11">Example</h2>
<p>Lisa, aged 40 years is working as a financial consultant. She is
a patient of high blood pressure and takes regular medication for it.
She decided to purchase a health insurance policy for herself. After
lots of research, she settled for a health insurance plan with a clause
for an exclusion period of 12 months for his pre-existing disease of
high BP. During the first year of her policy, no claims related to high
BP were entertained. However, her other claims during the period which
were not related to pre-existing diseases such as hospitalisation due to
malaria and other diagnosis tests were covered.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Exclusions</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The insurance company normally indicates various scenarios that cannot be
entertained for claim payments. The rationale behind is to avoid staged
or fraudulent claims, misuse insurance for profit motive and to keep
costs of claims low, and thus controls insurance premium costs. However,
customers usually do not fully understand the excluded conditions and
this could be a trust issue between the customer and the insurer.</p>
<p>Some of the common exclusions (list is indicative and not exhaustive)
are: a) Pre-existing illness b) Diseases contracted during initial
waiting period c) Expenses on treatment of specific ailments for a
specific period like hernia, fistula, and cataract etc. (which are
covered after the waiting period is over) d) Injury or disease due to
war, war like operations and similar scenarios e) Cosmetic surgery,
plastic surgery f) Dental treatment g) Abuse of drugs/alcohol usage h)
Naturopathy treatment i) Non-medical expenses for personal comfort like
television, telephone, toiletry items etc.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Cancellation clause</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Usually, this clause can only be invoked by the insurer for reasons of
fraud, moral hazard, misrepresentation or non-cooperation of the
insured. Similarly, the customer may also cancel the policy based on the
policy conditions and the insurance company is supposed to refund the
premium on short-term cover scales of the insurer. However the company
is liable for any claim, which arose prior to the date of cancellation.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Renewability clause</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="but-not-sending-it-will-not-tantamount-to-deficiency-in-services">After much discussion in this direction and as
required by the regulator, the industry&rsquo;s stand generally is that the
health insurance products will ordinarily be renewable. However, the
insurer is not responsible or liable for non-renewal of policy due to
non-receipt or delayed receipt of the renewal notice to the insured.
Also, the company may revise the premium rates, terms and conditions of
the policy at the time of renewal. Renewal of the policy is not
automatic and the premium due must be paid by the proposer to the
company before the due date. The insurer normally sends renewal notice
but not sending it will not tantamount to deficiency in services.</h2>
<h2 id="13-standardisation-initiatives">13. Standardisation initiatives</h2>
<p>In a unique multi- stakeholder
initiative in India, the insurance industry, regulator, hospitals and
industry chambers (FICCI and CII), along with other stakeholders, have
come together to undertake certain standardisation initiatives for the
health insurance industry, since 2007. Some of these are discussed
below.</p>
<h2 id="a-standardisation-of-definitions">a) Standardisation of definitions</h2>
<p>There are differences in the
definitions of certain terminology used in health insurance and in the
nomenclature and definitions of critical illnesses adopted by the
different insurers which can create confusion in the minds of consumers
and the industry. Lack of standard definitions also means that products
are difficult to compare, and the availability of standard definitions
thus can ensure better comparability and uniformity in the understanding
of health insurance products.</p>
<h2 id="b-standardisation-of-forms">b) Standardisation of forms</h2>
<p>The majority
of the insurers and TPAs require mostly the same information in their
pre-authorisation and claims forms. However, each of them uses different
formats and this means that a typical hospital would be expected to keep
stock of 30 or 40 different forms and understand them well. If the forms
would be standardised, they will be better understood, more complete and
more accurate. This was therefore taken up by the multistakeholder
working groups to develop and suggest to the industry for
standardisation of forms for pre-authorisation and claims which could be
used by all insurers and TPAs.</p>
<h2 id="c-standardisation-initiatives-on-the-non-medical-expenses">c) Standardisation initiatives on the non-medical expenses</h2>
<p>Insurance companies providing hospitalisation
indemnity covers generally exclude certain categories of expenses in
their policy terms and conditions. However, there is no detailed listing
of such excluded expenses, and the interpretation of these exclusions is
highly varied across different payers in the industry. There are many
cases when various items under the claims filed by hospital providers or
individual policyholders are repudiated by the insurers but are disputed
by the claimants. This is, thus, one major cause of acrimony between
insurance companies &amp; healthcare providers and also causes a lot of
confusion in the minds of consumer. Hence the stakeholders from the
insurance, TPA, medical providers joined together to come to a consensus
on the list of non-medical expenses to evolve an exhaustive list of such
items.</p>
<p>In February 2013, IRDA has brought out &lsquo;Guidelines for Standardization
in Health Insurance&rsquo; which among other thing cover above 3 items &ndash; key
definitions, standard forms and list of non-payable items. Refer
Annexure at the end of book for details.</p>
<h2 id="d-standardisation-of-treatment-guidelines-stg">d) Standardisation of treatment guidelines (STG)</h2>
<p>The aim of these treatment guidelines are to: i. Reduce
claim disputes substantially by providing a reference framework for
payers to process medical claims for these conditions. This in turn,
helps in reducing the needs for moving back and forth of queries between
payers and providers. ii. Enable increased automation of claims
handling, resulting in faster claim processing and reduction of TATs
(turnaround time) for a significant proportion of claims. iii. Help in
setting appropriate grades/levels of payout for different types of
surgeries in fixed benefit plans and setting scientific and reasonable
sublimits for different procedures in reimbursement plans. iv. Provide a
framework for costing and for development of appropriate price range for
these conditions in different situations. The guidelines also provide
the essential investigations which need to be carried out in case of a
particular condition, as also any specific additional ones, which may be
opted for in case of specified circumstances. The guidelines also
include a detailed discussion on implants or other surgical consumables,
including specific recommendations which meet quality expectations at a
reasonable cost to the system. Conclusion: there are no ideal product
