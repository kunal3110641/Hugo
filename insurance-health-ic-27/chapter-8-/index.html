<h2 id="customer-service-in-health-insurance">CUSTOMER SERVICE IN HEALTH INSURANCE</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter introduction</h2>
<p>The chapter discusses how the consumer
(policyholder) protection can be achieved and lists various channels
where consumer can register their complaints relating to personal
insurance claims.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>A. Consumer protection B. Claim servicing C. Grievance
redressal</p>
<h2 id="a-consumer-protection">A. Consumer protection</h2>
<p>Effective policyholder protection is one of the
most important components of a sound and competitive insurance market.
Where this is lacking, prospects and policyholders could be exposed to
unfair practices by insurers. They could be subject to competitive
market pressures, especially when the products are complex. The crux of
the problem from the consumer protection point of view is the
information asymmetry and the imbalance of the power, information and
resources between policyholders and insurers. Prospects and
policyholders could be at a disadvantage, though theoretically (and
sometimes in practice), the information asymmetry may work the other way
around as well. However, more often than not, insurance being a legal
contract with detailed terms; it is the policyholder who is vulnerable
to lack of awareness about policy conditions. Consumer protection or
policyholder&rsquo;s protection can be achieved if certain basic parameters
are followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transparency</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The policy sale represents the start of
the insurance contract. The clarity of information at the time of the
sale process is important to avoid dissonance later, at the time of
claims. Customers need to have transparency of information at every
stage of the policy lifecycle. All the touch points like website,
emails, letter, branch, call centre should be information-driven clearly
informing the customer what he or she needs to know.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Customer centric service</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Customer centric services hinges around delivering on the
promise undertaken by the insurance companies to deliver their
commitment towards quality service. Service processes must be designed
by stepping into the shoes of the customer. Insurance being a matter of
solicitation just does not restrict only to pre-sale services but
extends to the post-sales services and renewal as well.</p>
<h2 id="3-ability-to-settle-genuine-claims-promptly">3. Ability to settle genuine claims promptly</h2>
<p>It is mainly at the time
of claims where policy terms and conditions come into play. If the same
is explained to the customer, then the claim process becomes smooth and
hassle free with minimal dissonance. The claim settlement process of an
insurer portrays the ability to put in place a robust claim assessment
process, which ensures that genuine claims are cleared speedily and
fraudulent claims are identified and blocked, with steps taken to
minimise their recurrence.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Consumer education</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Consumer protection and
consumer education complement each other. Consumer education not only
helps the individual understand the product and risks involved better,
but is also a necessity to understand market efficiency.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Robust technology</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Technology plays a major role in making the process easy,
quick and frictionless. A robust system should allow the complete
tracking of all details and status updates, via SMS and Email to keep
the customer abreast of the progress of their requests. Regardless of
the channel from which the policy may have been purchased, companies are
now offering their customers 24x7 access via a single toll free number,
providing the confidence to the insured that the insurer is just a call
away. A customer may contact the company through any of the following
modes:</p>
<p>Diagram 1: Modes of contact</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Customer_servicesin_health_insurance_81.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>The request received from the customer with respect to health insurance
may be related to cancellations, policy related, endorsement related,
product clarification, claims status etc. These requests can either be
quick fixes i.e. resolved at the touch-point itself, usually termed as a
First Call Resolution (FCR), or be assigned to the various resolution
teams who process these cases and update the status against the service
requests raised in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
application. The resolution is updated to the customers via SMS, e-mails
or letters. To ensure customer delight and faster servicing, insurers
should strive to resolve most of the service requests on the first call
itself. For this, the core CRM application needs to be integrated with
other base systems so that there is more information availability at the
front-end with empowerment to close the request as an FCR. IVR-CTI is
another technology that is being looked into, which essentially means
integration of the insurer&rsquo;s CRM system with the incoming customer call.
Several servicing opportunities open up once this technology is
implemented, as customers would be recognised from the call itself and
all customer information is readily available in an instant to the
front-end user. Call recording solutions are now omnipresent to enable
recording of all phone conversations at the call centre, which can be
easily retrieved to protect the policy holder in case of a dispute.
Efficient CRMs thus facilitate and compliment efficient customer
support. Maintenance of and access to customer records is made quick and
easy thereby facilitating better customer service. A robust technology
platform also enables accurate MIS and reporting.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Fair treatment</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Fair treatment at every stage, both before and after sales makes insurance
attractive to the customer and keeps his confidence in the same. Health
Insurance being the most varied product based on requirement, need,
lifestyle and standard of living, pricing plays a major role. With clear
and unambiguous terms and conditions, price should be adequate, neither
too high making it unattractive for the customer, nor too low thereby
endangering the insurer&rsquo;s solvency. Insurers must aim to deliver a
structured and fair basis for determining health benefits and pay outs.</p>
<h2 id="7-health-data-repository">7. Health Data Repository</h2>
<p>In the health insurance industry, asymmetric
information &ndash; a situation involving a transaction where one party has
more information than the other &ndash; leads to adverse selection wherein
individuals with high healthcare costs are more likely to buy insurance.
The unavailability of reliable information undermines the underwriting
capabilities of the insurance companies, leading to increased insurance
costs. Hence, it is essential to build a dependable source of
information at the industry level with respect to claims, medical
treatment costs and health cases, which can be leveraged by insurers to
ensure that the cover is rightly priced and insurance costs are under
control. Industry data on health insurance claims is now available on
the IRDA and IIB (Insurance Information Bureau) website. A common health
data repository supported by standardised formats of capture of health
data is a critical initiative for the industry that will help provide
right priced insurance solutions to customers.</p>

<h2 id="b-claim-servicing">B. Claim servicing</h2>
<p>An insurance policy promises to pay a &lsquo;claim&rsquo; when
the insured event occurs as per the terms of the policy.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>A &lsquo;claim&rsquo; also refers to the documents and process by which
the insured demands the admissible insured amount from the insurance
company. An insurance company: a) b)</p>
<p>Either makes a direct payment to the hospital (cashless facility) and
reimburses the expenses associated with the illness to the policyholder
Or disburses a fixed benefit on occurrence of an illness depending on
the product</p>
<h2 id="definition-1">Definition</h2>
<p>Cashless hospitalisation is a service provided by an insurer
wherein the insured is not required to settle the hospitalisation
expenses at the time of discharge from hospital, to the extent covered
by policy The settlement is done directly by the insurance company.
However, prior approval is required before the patient is admitted into
the hospital. An insurance company settles the claim through its own
claim processing department (&lsquo;in-house&rsquo;) or ties up with a Third Party
Administrator (TPA) which undertakes to do this on behalf of the
insurance company.</p>
<h2 id="definition-2">Definition</h2>
<p>A hospital, which has an agreement with a TPA/Insurer for
providing cashless treatment, is referred to as a 'Network Hospital'.</p>
<h2 id="tip">Tip</h2>
<p>Cashless facility is provided only at the network hospitals.</p>
<h2 id="definition-3">Definition</h2>
<p>Non-network hospitals are those which do not have tie-up with
TPA and any policyholder seeking treatment in these hospitals would have
to pay for the treatment and later claim as per the reimbursement
procedure.
Diagram 2: Types of cashless claims
Cashless claims can be of two types: planned and emergency.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Customer_servicesin_health_insurance_82.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>The procedure for making a claim varies with each company and/or the
product or policy terms, but keeping a few general points in mind
ensures a speedy claim settlement and prevents rejection of the claim.
The claim settlement paid by the Insurance Company comprises only the
expenses admissible and actually incurred. On the other hand, in case of
benefit policies like hospital daily cash and critical illness policies,
the insured is paid the pre-specified lump sum amount regardless of the
actual expenses incurred. Claims that are not admissible, fully or
partially, as per the policy conditions, can be repudiated / rejected by
the insurers. It is important to know that partial reductions in claimed
amount are usually due to deficiency of supporting documents or for
expenses, which are not covered under the policy. In case of the former,
if the requisite documents are made available, the claim may be
considered. Repudiation can be prevented by carefully reading the policy
for its scope of coverage, co-payments and sub-limits applicable and the
exclusions, and by ensuring that the insured has correctly declared the
health status including any pre-existing diseases at the time of
proposal for the insurance policy. It also helps in the relationship if
the repudiation letter from the insurer clearly provides the reasons and
rationale for a deduction in the claimed amount. In cases where the
insured is not satisfied by the reasons for rejection, he/she can
represent the same to the insurer. Grievances not resolved by the
insurers within one month can also be taken up with the Insurance
Ombudsman within whose jurisdiction the policy is issued.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-2">Test Yourself 2</h2>
<p>Which of the following is incorrect with regards to
cashless facility in health insurance? I. Insured is required to settle
the hospitalisation expenses at the time of discharge from hospital II.
Provided only at the network hospitals III. Under the planned cashless
claims, the insured is aware of the hospitalisation 2-3 days in advance
IV. Under the emergency cashless claims, the insured meets with sudden
accident that requires immediate hospitalisation</p>
<h2 id="c-grievance-redressal">C. Grievance redressal</h2>
<p>Policyholders must be provided with inexpensive
and speedy mechanism for complaints disposal. Policyholders may have
complaints against insurers in respect of either their policies or their
claims. As per Regulation 5 of IRDA Protection of Policyholders
Interests regulations, 2002, every insurer should have in place a
grievance redressal system to address the complaints of the
policyholders. Over and above this, one may approach the Insurance
Ombudsman for complaints relating to personal insurance claims for value
of up to Rs. 20 lakhs. The other channels available to a policyholder
are the Consumer Courts and the Civil Courts. The IRDA has a Grievance
Redressal Cell, which plays a facilitative role by taking up complaints
against insurers with the respective companies for a speedy resolution.
When a policyholder has a complaint to make, he/ she must first approach
the Grievance or Consumer Complaints cell of the insurer. In the event
of there being no response or no satisfactory response, the policyholder
may write to the Grievance Redressal Cell of the IRDA, which will then
take up the matter with the concerned company for examination or
re-examination. Only cases of delay or non-response regarding matters
relating to policies and claims are taken up by the Cell with the
insurers for a speedy disposal. If the complainant is looking for
adjudication in respect of claims, he/ she may approach the Insurance
Ombudsman. The office of the Ombudsman was set up under the Redressal of
Public Grievances Rules, 1998 framed by the Central Government.</p>
<p>The rules apply to all the insurance companies operating in the general
insurance and life insurance sectors. The objects of the rules are to
resolve all complaints relating to settlement of claim on the part of
insurance companies in a cost-effective, efficient and impartial manner.
The rules stipulate that there shall be a governing body of the
Insurance Council, which shall consist of one representative from each
of the Insurance companies. The governing body shall appoint Ombudsmen
for the purpose of these rules. Any person who has a grievance against
an insurer, may himself or through his legal heirs make a complaint in
writing to the Ombudsman within whose jurisdiction the branch or office
of the insurer complained against is located. The Ombudsman may either
make a recommendation through mediation or pass an award, which he/she
thinks is fair as per the facts and circumstances of a claim.</p>

<hr>
<p>a) The Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum known as &ldquo;District Forum&rdquo; established
by the State Government in each district of State by notification can
entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services and the
compensation, if any, claimed 'does not exceed Rs. 20 lakhs. b)
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission known as &ldquo;State Commission&rdquo;
established by state government in a state can entertain: i. Complaints
where the value of the goods or services and compensation, if any,
claimed exceeds Rs. 20 lakhs, but does not exceed Rs. 1 crore; and ii.
Appeals against the orders of any District Forum within the State c)
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission established by Central
Government by notification, known as the &ldquo;National Commission&rdquo; can

<h2 id="2-best-practice-survey-on-grievance-redressal">2. Best practice survey on grievance redressal</h2>
<p>A best practice survey
in the areas of customer protection during the sales process and
grievance redressal was undertaken by the CII Communication and
Awareness working group. These best practices have been circulated
amongst the insurance companies for their reference and for rating in
terms of importance. The best practice questionnaire was sent to all the
General Insurance and standalone Health Insurance companies, of which
40% responded. Some of the results are given below. 9 Customer
Protection during the Sales Process: 9 Relative performance of the
different dimensions: While most of the dimensions have received scores
within a narrow band, an adequate training facility for agents is seen
to have the highest importance followed by the use of technology for
efficiencies in distribution of health insurance.</p>

<h2 id="3-conclusion">3. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Health insurance should be available to all. The
challenge moves around consumer awareness and protection and in making
products available which consumers can understand better. There is also
a need for process efficiencies to be strengthened for restoring the

and strengthened by the use of technology is the way forward for India&rsquo;s
health insurance sector.</p>
