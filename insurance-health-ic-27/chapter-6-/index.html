<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter aims to provide you with knowledge
about importance of data for health insurance, various sources of data
for health insurance and how is it collected and analysed for various
purposes. It will also brief you about the IRDA&rsquo;s role in collecting,
processing and disseminating the health insurance data. It will also
discuss the actuarial role and techniques for pricing and reserving in
health insurance.</p>

of health insurance data C. Actuarial function in a health insurance
company</p>
<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this Scenario</h2>
<p>In the current market, data is one of the most
valuable resources. However, data is not useful unless it can be
processed and turned into information that allows a business competitive
advantage. Though we have various information systems to collect
information, sometimes, it just results in loads of information with no
direction. This is because when data is collected, it is usually
presented in various forms and formats which makes it out of order.
Therefore, we need a proper system to use the data to help us in
decision-making, pricing of products, testing various hypotheses and
identifying trends and opportunities. In the arena of health insurance,
thousands of claims are generated every day, including hospitals,
physicians, and pharmacies. A number of TPAs process these claims and
route them to the appropriate payer. Thus, the TPAs carry huge amounts
of data that runs in thousands everyday but other than routing them, no
other purpose is served from the data. It was in this context that IRDA
constituted Insurance Information Bureau (IIB) to manage the information
of the insurance industry as a central data repository. Data queries and
analyses have been facilitated greatly with the help of such data
warehousing and now the data is used increasingly by a wide variety of
employees, , hospitals, insurers and other stakeholders in the industry.
We will discuss various data collecting, processing and analysing
techniques in detail in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="a-data-in-health-insurance">A. Data in health insurance</h2>
<p>With the growing complexity of health
insurance business and ever changing market scenario there is a need for
scientific pricing and designing of insurance products. Data is one of
the vital elements of health insurance business. Policy design, business
performance monitoring, product pricing, financial reporting, asset
liability management etc., are all dependent on historical data. Data is
also used in different forms in various departments other than just its
use for actuarial purposes. Thus, underwriting, claims, marketing and
sales departments are also consumers of health insurance data. Third
party administrators (TPA) in India which process the claims for an
insurer also analyse data and provide reports to the insurance companies
on a periodical basis. Data is also used extensively by the policy
makers such as Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA),
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Finance etc. We will
discuss the importance of data, elements of data, data analysis
techniques and latest industry developments and initiatives in the
subsequent sections.</p>
<h2 id="1-importance-of-data-in-health-insurance">1. Importance of data in health insurance</h2>
<p>The importance of data of the
health insurance industry for various sectors is summarised below:</p>
<h2 id="a-for-insurers">a) For insurers</h2>
<p>i. Management: Use data analysis reports generated from the
experience data to make informed decisions and take corrective actions
related to pricing, product design, business plans, marketing strategy
etc.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>The management of an insurance company received an annual report
providing data about profitability ratios for their various insurance
products. On analysis of that data, the management decided to modify the
premium for some products which were giving higher than usual loss
ratios within the next three months to achieve the desired profitability
or control over losses. On taking this corrective action related to
product pricing, they got the desired results in their subsequent annual
reports. ii. Actuaries: Perform most of the rating and underwriting
analyses including experience rating, classification and segmentation
analysis and internal tariff development. iii. Underwriters: Use data to
study the pattern indicated by the data to decide the acceptance or
denial of a risk. An underwriter also uses data to load premiums or
provide discounts for a particular kind of risk.</p>
<p>Example Insurance underwriting is the process of selection,
classification and rating of risks and it cannot be performed
effectively without the availability of sufficient data. Underwriters
review applications for insurance coverage submitted to the company.
They collect data from various sources to investigate the factors
affecting the probability of loss and to determine whether or not to
accept a particular applicant. They analyse information on the policy
application and collect additional data. They study medical reports and
also obtain detailed data about the applicant's occupation and
involvement with hazardous tasks or other risky activities. In addition,
they apply actuarial tables which give the statistical probability of
loss based on actual experience of large groups of people over many
years. After deciding that an applicant is an acceptable risk,
underwriters usually determine the amount of the premium. Underwriters
usually need more data and detailed analysis for underwriting individual
health insurance than group health insurance. IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE</p>
<p>iv. Finance: Use data to evaluate the company&rsquo;s liabilities for
financial reporting and maintaining solvency margins as stipulated by
the regulator. v. Others: Marketing and sales department use data to
benchmark the performance of underwriting offices and staff members.
Data is also used for provider contracting function in establishing fair
yet competitive fees to pay providers.</p>
<h2 id="b-for-regulators">b) For regulators</h2>
<p>Use data to
analyse the overall performance of the sector, to keep track of market
developments, to frame policies in regards to solvency margins, file and
use, customer education and awareness etc.</p>
<h2 id="c-for-government">c) For Government</h2>
<p>Data is
used by various ministries in formulating social schemes such as
Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), Arogyashri which may require
detailed study of the historical data related to disease burden,
socioeconomic factors, claims experience etc.</p>
<h2 id="d-for-tpas">d) For TPAs</h2>
<p>Use data to
evaluate their own performance in terms of claim settlement, turn-around
time, impact of prior-authorisation etc., as also to improve the
business intelligence of their processing systems which can help
automatically alert outliers.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>TPAs (Third Party Administrators) function as an intermediary
between the insurer and the insured and facilitate cashless services of
insurance. The TPAs process and approve the bills. The TPAs use the
health insurance data to develop appropriate systems and management
structures for controlling cost, develop procedures to minimise
unnecessary treatments/investigations, improve quality of services and
ultimately lead to lower insurance premiums.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Health_Insurancedata_Pricing_and_Reserving.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="e-for-other-stakeholders">e) For other stakeholders</h2>
<p>Providers, brokers, consulting firms,
industry bodies (CII, FICCI) and international bodies (WHO, World Bank)
also uses data for various different purposes.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>Healthcare providers can use the health insurance database for
taking initiative to deliver services to their patients in a high
quality and efficient manner. They can take action to increase the
patient outcomes, but at reduced cost. Providers can also use this data
to identify the gaps in the service provided and improve delivery and
patient satisfaction.</p>

<li>Basic health insurance data elements</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>IRDA
requires insurance companies / TPAs to capture and report data in a
specified format. It helps to ascertain that data is collected and
reported in a standard format across all the insurers. Following are the
tables in which data is required to be submitted to IRDA on a periodical
basis:</p>
<h2 id="a-policy-data-table-a">a) Policy data (Table A)</h2>
<p>The policy level information is
contained in this table. It has details such as the total number of
members covered under a policy, policy premium, start date and end date
of policy.</p>
<h2 id="b-member-data-table-b">b) Member data (Table B)</h2>
<p>This table contains information about the
individual members covered under the policy. The details include the age
or date of birth of member, sum insured, gender and relationship with
the insured.</p>
<h2 id="c-claims-data-table-c">c) Claims data (Table C)</h2>
<p>Information on claims made by the
members covered is contained in this table. The details include the date
of admission and discharge, diagnosis description and code, name of the
hospital, amount paid as well as claimed and the date of payment.</p>
<h2 id="d-outstanding-claims-data">d) Outstanding claims data</h2>
<p>This table shows the outstanding claim amount at
the beginning and close of each financial year as well as the total
amount paid during the year in aggregate. The table below shows the list
of important fields which are covered in Tables A, B and C. Table 6.1

<h2 id="3-other-available-data-sources">3. Other available data sources</h2>
<p>Apart from the data maintained by
commercial insurance companies, there are other data sources that are
used in the health insurance industry such as: a) Data published by
government such as census data, disease burden, income and expenditure
data of individuals, public and private infrastructure (hospitals,
doctors, nurses) data etc. b) Data published by other organisations such
as WHO, World Bank, Indian statistical organisation, CII, FICCI, IMA
etc. c) Data published by existing government health schemes (centre and
state) &ndash; CGHS, ESIS, RSBY etc. 4. Data warehousing</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>A data warehouse is a repository of an organisation's
electronically stored data, designed to facilitate reporting and
analysis. An expanded definition for data warehousing includes business
intelligence tools to extract, transform and load data into the
repository, and to manage and retrieve large volumes of data. Thus, the
essential components of a data warehousing system are: a) To retrieve
and analyse data, b) To extract, transform and load data, and c) To
manage the data dictionary A data warehouse provides a framework for
query, reporting and analysis. It contains time-variant, non-volatile,
historical and subject-oriented data. Like other major IT solutions, the
initial step is to define the scope, business goals and requirements for
building a data warehouse. Critical to this is an understanding of data
available that normally happens by first identifying business focus
areas and determining what data they generate and how it can be
collected.</p>
<p>In India, a data warehouse is used to store and summarise the health
insurance data in Table A, B and C format as prescribed by the IRDA. A
good data warehouse system should be able to: a) Store data that may
come in different formats such as SQL, SAS, MS Access etc. b) Provide
flexibility to the user to access data from different locations c)
Perform basic and advanced data validation d) Capture and store the data
in a standard format for example insurer e) names, cities and hospital
names could be coded or with drop down menu to avoid spelling errors or
variations in spelling f) Archive historical data and keep periodical
backups g) Provide flexibility to the user to generate reports that are
useful for analysis and can be given to top management for a review h)
Keep user interface easy to navigate so that non-technical personnel can
also use it for reporting and analysis purposes</p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example</h2>
<p>An insurance company can use the data warehouse to access data
related to market trends. The insurer can develop profiles of different
customers using information such as demographics, behavioural or
lifestyle data, product and service utilisation, survey data and
information about customer healthcare attitudes. The insurer can use
this knowledge to keep its customers happy by delivering best products
and care to them. Data warehousing can also provide information about
the products and services mostly used by the customers. It also provides
information about the specific products to be targeted to specific
populations. Insurers can also use the marketing data to track the
responses of the customers for a specific product so that if required,
it can be evaluated and refined on time.</p>

</ol>
<hr>
<p>Insurance
Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) was set up to protect the
interests of the policyholders and to regulate, promote and ensure
orderly growth of the insurance industry. To accomplish this objective
and for the efficient functioning of the insurers, it is important that
reliable, timely and accurate data is collected, processed and
disseminated by an independent body. Data is important for any industry
and especially for the insurance industry which is essentially data
oriented. IRDA, therefore, constituted an Insurance Information Bureau
(IIB) in 2009 to provide reliable data on the sector to researchers and
policy makers. Before the IIB was created by IRDA in 2009, health
insurance industry sent the data to the Tariff Advisory Committee (TAC)
since the year 2004. Section 64 UE of the Insurance Act, 1938,
inter-alia authorised TAC to require and collect information etc. The
TAC also published a Health Insurance Data Reporting Manual which
contained detailed instructions on acceptable data structures to
standardise data collection. Data table formats and manual developed by
TAC were revised in 2008 and were then adopted by IRDA, which later
authorised IIB to perform the function of collecting, collating and
disseminating data earlier vested with TAC.</p>
<h2 id="example-4">Example</h2>
<p>Data compilation, storage and analysis in the Indian health
insurance sector got a major boost with the introduction of TPAs. The
TPAs have emerged as the custodians for enrollment and claims data for
their clients. They manage the policyholder details through the readily
available tailor-made software for such purposes and provide it to IIB
periodically. However, the data stored by different TPAs may have
significant variation in terms of quality and consistency. By virtue of
powers vested with the IRDA to seek information and returns, under
section 14 (2) (h) of the IRDA Act and under sections 14, 21 and 110c of
the Insurance Act, all insurers have been directed to submit information
to the IIB in the data formats specified by IRDA within time limits
fixed by IRDA. IIB has created a data warehouse which will enable
insurers, other stake holders and researchers to have easy access to
validated data from one source. IIB collects data from all insurers (and
TPAs), integrates the data into logical subject areas, stores the data
in a manner that is accessible and understandable to decision makers and
delivers data / information to decision makers through report writing
and query tools. Aggregated analysis of health insurance data is also
made available on the IRDA website.</p>
<p>IRDA will be the sole and exclusive owner of all data collected /
received from the insurance industry. Users will be provided with only
specific levels of permissions to use the said data. IRDA also reserves
the right to impose restrictions on the use of data and publication of
findings from the data. IIB&rsquo;s governance is done through an advisory
committee consisting of IRDA Chairman as Chairman, Director General (R &amp;
D) as Vice Chairman, Executive Director (Administration), IRDA as
Convener, three data management experts, Secretary Generals of life and
non-life insurance councils, a representative each from the life
insurance and non-life insurance business who will be engaged as members
on annual rotation basis.</p>

<h2 id="2-data-interpretation">2. Data interpretation</h2>
<p>Analysis of data can be performed on various
parameters and at different levels of complexity. Following are few
examples of analysis at the elementary level:</p>
<h2 id="a-written-premium">a) Written premium</h2>
<p>Premium received by an insurer in a particular period (policy year) This
analysis can show the number of people covered and policy premium
received by type and by written policy year for each underwriting
office. This helps in identifying the average premium (on per person
basis) for both group and individual policy. This will help an insurer
to understand where to focus its sales and marketing efforts. This will
also help to monitor the result of rate actions taken by the various
underwriting offices.</p>
<h2 id="example-5">Example</h2>
<p>An insurance company introduces a low cost health insurance
product for the people staying in rural areas. The cost of the product
was as low as Rs.10 per member per month in a family. As the company
introduces the product for the first time and that too at a very low
cost, it was concerned about the results. However, the analysis done at
the end of the year on written premiums for the product were quite
surprising. The product was able to attract many people in rural areas
due to its low cost which resulted in a strong policyholder base and
overall profitability. The company therefore, decided to continue the
product at the same price.</p>
<h2 id="b-earned-premium">b) Earned premium</h2>
<p>The portion of an insurance
written premium which is considered &quot;earned&quot; by the insurer, based on
the ratio of the time elapsed on the policy to its effective life. This
analysis can divide the written premium for each of the policy years
into two segments: earned premium for the current year and the balance
for the remaining period for which the insurance coverage will continue.</p>
<h2 id="example-6">Example</h2>
<p>Ketan has taken a health insurance policy in July 2012 and paid
a premium of Rs.10,000 for two years. By December 2012, six months had
passed and there were no claims made by Ketan during this period. So,
the insurance company will have an earned premium amount of Rs.2,500
(Rs.10,000 x 6 months/24 months) for 6 months. This amount is now profit
for the insurance company. The calculation of earned premium has two
major uses: i. It helps in calculating the unearned premium reserve at
the end of the accounting period, which needs to be shown in the
financial statements. ii. It is used to calculate the insurer&rsquo;s loss
ratios for different products where total losses or claims for a period
are divided by the earned premium for the corresponding period.</p>
<h2 id="c-age-distribution">c) Age distribution</h2>
<p>This is the number of people covered in different age bands
for both group and individual policies. This analysis is used to: i.
Study the percentage share of each of the age categories for each policy
year</p>
<p>ii. Understand the customer profile changes from year to year in
different age bands. iii. Understand the demographics of covered people
and therefore their risk profile.</p>
<h2 id="d-group-size-distribution">d) Group size distribution</h2>
<p>Group size is an important indicator for risk. Small groups represent riskier
business while large groups represent less risk from an underwriting
perspective. This analysis can show the number of people covered and the
premium for different group sizes for both group and individual
policies. This analysis is used to: i. Study the average premium (per
person) ii. Study the percentage share of number of people for the
corresponding product categories in proportion to the total number of
people. iii. Illustrate premium per person for different groups iv.
Understand the change in claims cost from year to year, and v.
Facilitate monitoring the individual, small group and large group blocks
of business separately.</p>
<h2 id="example-7">Example</h2>
<p>An insurance company, while providing group insurance coverage
to large groups, generally does not ask employees to fill out a medical
questionnaire prior to obtaining coverage. So, the company will have to
do the data analysis of the previous available records of the group. The
data analysis related to prior history of employee participation in the
group insurance plan, claims experience of the group in the past years
as well as any overall increases in the cost of providing health
insurance coverage can help the insurance company to set the annual
premium rates for the group.</p>
<h2 id="e-claims-probability-distribution">e) Claims probability distribution</h2>
<p>This is
the distribution of the number of claims paid and the corresponding
claim amount paid for different amount paid ranges. Claim probability
for any individual is related to the expected number of claims occurring
in a given year and the cost associated with each such claim. This is
used to study the percentage of total claim amount paid for each claim
range in proportion to the total claim amount paid. The claims analysis
helps to calculate the expected frequency and average amount of claim in
different claim ranges. This can be used further to calculate the
expected amount per claim. This distribution is vital to understand the
probability of claims of certain sizes. With this knowledge the actuary
can develop the expected cost of claims for policies with various
sum-insured amounts. This would also form the basis of the rate
calculation for sum-insured policies.</p>
<h2 id="f-claims-analysis">f) Claims analysis</h2>
<p>This analysis can show the amount of claim, the
total amount paid and the amount paid for different benefits, including
room, nursing, surgery, miscellaneous etc. It can show the total amount
of claims paid and the corresponding number of claims for different
years and the components of claim costs. This analysis can be done under
various categories such as:</p>
<h2 id="i-claims-analysis-by-sum-insured">i. Claims analysis by sum insured</h2>
<p>This
analysis can show the distribution of number of claims paid and the
corresponding claim amount paid for different ranges of sum insured.
This is used to study the percentage of total claim amount paid for each
sum insured range. This analysis will help insurer to point out the
utilisation level at different sum insured ranges.</p>
<h2 id="ii-claims-analysis-by-age-bands">ii. Claims analysis by age bands</h2>
<p>This analysis studies the number of claims and the amount
paid for each age band and hence reflects the average amount and the
percentage of total amount paid for the respective age bands. This
analysis helps in identifying the frequency and severity of claims from
different age bands.</p>
<h2 id="iii-claims-analysis-by-geographic-locations">iii. Claims analysis by geographic locations</h2>
<p>Claim
frequency and severity can be calculated separately for each geographic
region. In addition an analysis by geographic location on the basis of
ICD codes (discussed later in detail in this chapter) can indicate which
geographic areas have a higher likelihood for a particular disease or
have higher healthcare costs; some loading can be appropriately done
while doing premium rating when this analysis is backed by sufficient
data. This analysis will help insurers pointing out the high cost
location and revising its sales and rating strategies.</p>
<h2 id="iv-claims-analysis-by-hospitals">iv. Claims analysis by hospitals</h2>
<p>Comparative analysis by hospitals to illustrate
the amount paid to each hospital on the basis of ICD diagnosis codes.
This would show the average and total amount paid to each hospital for
various ICD codes. This analysis will help insurers pointing out the
high cost hospitals and renegotiating terms with them.</p>
<h2 id="example-8">Example</h2>
<p>Claims analysis done on the basis of geographical locations
takes into consideration the topography, physical factors of the region,
economic factors involved in that region, political stability,
industrial development, trade activities, lifestyles and other varied
factors. The insurance companies usually charge higher premiums from
customers staying in metropolitan cities than people staying in rural
areas. This is because the people staying in cities are more prone to
health risks and accidents than people staying in village areas.
Moreover, the most common diseases nowadays like diabetes, hypertension,
obesity etc. are also more frequent in cities than in villages due to
lifestyle. The people staying in rural areas are more exposed to fresh
air, food and environment, so the chances of their becoming sick are
comparatively less.</p>
<h2 id="g-payment-duration-analysis">g) Payment duration analysis</h2>
<p>This is total number of
claims settled by the end of each month from the month of claim
occurrence. Hence, it reflects the percentage number of claims settled
by the end of each month in proportion to the total number of claims
paid up to the end of the year. Analysing the claims paid with the
duration of payment helps in cash flow planning and identifying the
settlement period of claims. This analysis can be done on the basis of
type of claims, hospitals and cities to determine the reasons for
settlement delay.</p>
<h2 id="h-ibnr-incurred-but-not-reported-analysis">h) IBNR (Incurred but not reported) analysis</h2>
<p>Reserving
for the claims which are incurred but not reported at the end of the
accounting period The IBNR data analysis can be used to: i.</p>
<p>Show the development of incremental payments by the month of payment ii.
Show the development of cumulative payments for each month. iii. Show
percentage completion of payments, based on selected factors, by the end
of corresponding number of months for each month of claim occurrence.
iv. Show the total claims paid to date, estimated outstanding liability
and the completion percentage. v. Help an insurer estimate its reserves
appropriately. vi. Estimate the full incurred claims for any time period
under study. vii. Perform rating and trend analysis and every other
special ad hoc analysis of claims expense undertaken by the insurer
viii. Assist the insurer in filing the annual outstanding liability
report with the regulator.</p>
<p>i) Analysis by diagnosis grouping and provider network analysis
Analysis to show the quality and efficiency of service providers
(hospitals) i. The claim data can be analysed by the type of diagnosis,
period of stay in the hospital and cost of service provided by them. ii.
This helps in identifying the major disease group, their claim frequency
and the cost of treatment by provider. iii. This helps an insurer to
ascertain the quality of care and appropriateness of the charges made by
providers. iv. This will also help avoiding misuse, frauds and help in
contracting with providers.</p>
<p>Example The analysis of data related to healthcare providers can help
insurer to detect frauds by the providers. The analysis can be done on
parameters such as treatment costs higher than usual, suggestive of
costlier investigations, extended duration of stay in the hospital most
of the times, unrelated diagnosis and investigations etc. which can
trigger the misuse of health insurance by the providers etc. The
insurance company can ban such healthcare provider from their list.</p>

<hr>
<p>In more advanced analysis of the data, many parameters
can be used to drill down and look at more specific numbers for both
premiums and claims. The table below enlists a sample of some of the

<p>IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE</p>
<h2 id="4-icd-10-coding-system">4. ICD-10 coding system</h2>
<p>The international statistical classification of
diseases and related health problems (most commonly known by the
abbreviation ICD) provides codes to classify diseases and a wide variety
of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances
and external causes of injury or disease. Every health condition can be
assigned to a unique category and given a code, up to six characters
long. Such categories can include a set of similar diseases. The
international classification of diseases is published by the World
Health Organisation. The ICD is used world-wide for morbidity and
mortality statistics, reimbursement systems and automated decision
support in medicine. This system is designed to promote international
comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and
presentation of these statistics. The ICD is a core classification of
the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC). Countries
need to adopt and implement this classification so that the morbidity
and mortality databases are comparable within the various region/states
of the country and between countries of the region/world. Such reliable
information is essential for meaningful conclusion on the health status
of the population and for planning the development of facilities for
medical and healthcare and their efficient functioning. The ICD is
revised periodically and is currently in its tenth edition. Since Indian
industry was still in its nascent stage in terms of data collection and
analysis when the decision to implement a disease coding system was
being formulated around the year 2004, the latest available version was
the tenth one (abbreviated as ICD-10) and was considered as the best
alternative. In India, the ICD code is generally assigned at the time of
discharge either by the hospital staff or more frequently, by the TPAs
at the time of claim processing. ICDs can be used for the following
purposes: a) For analysis of the general disease profile of population
group b) For monitoring of the incidence and prevalence of diseases and
other health problems in relation to other variables such as the
characteristics and circumstances of the individuals affected c) For
analysing medical cost and utilisation trends by location and by
provider d) For analysing impact of seasonality on disease occurrence e)
For benefit pricing and negotiating costs. In addition ICD10 also
provides the basis for compilation of national mortality and morbidity
statistics by WHO member states. It is a critical input for the provider
payment mechanism known as Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) where the
payment to the provider is linked to the diagnosis of the ailment and
not to the input of services. 130 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE</p>

<h2 id="c-actuarial-function-in-a-health-insurance-company">C. Actuarial function in a health insurance company</h2>
<p>Insurance is a
business of transfer of future risk. A policy holder pays premium to an
insurance company and in return the insurance company promises to
compensate for any unforeseen losses during the covered period.
Insurance companies rely on their estimates of likely future payments
for such claims to be able to be in profit at the end of the covered
period. For any policy (or a set of policies), the company shall know
about its profit for sure only after the covered period is over. If the
premium it received fell short of the total payments it made (plus other
operating expenses) then the insurance company would make a loss.
Therefore to remain in profit, the company may take various steps: a)
Collect right amount of premium b) Sell the policies to only the &lsquo;good&rsquo;
or &lsquo;standard&rsquo; risks c) Manage claims so that there are no extra claim
payments Apart from these steps, to be able to remain solvent at all
times, the company needs to maintain a reserve for the policies it has
sold. An actuarial department of a health insurance company will help
the company in these two major tasks: i. Calculate the premium for each
product ii. Calculate the reserve to keep for the policies sold</p>
<p>Actuaries conduct various analyses to assist in the above two tasks such
as: i. Analysis of expenses ii. Analysis of movement of policies such as
renewal, cancellations etc iii. Asset liability modeling iv. Analysis
for modeling customer behaviour such as fraud, renewal etc. Actuaries,
therefore, play an important role in the design of health insurance
products with the help of various data analysis and morbidity tables.</p>
<ol>
<li>Actuarial techniques</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Actuarial science is a blend of four subjects:
statistics, mathematics, finance and economics. As the actuary needs to
estimate the future likely experience based on the past data,
statistical techniques are frequently used for actuarial work. Economics
is used to understand the impact of macro-economic factors on the
assumptions used such as long term interest rate. Finance and
mathematics helps in understanding the corporate governance structure
and the financial securities available in the market.</p>
<h2 id="example-10">Example</h2>
<p>Nayan purchased a life insurance policy which pays Rs 100,000 to
the policy holder at the end of five years in case he is alive at that
time. To calculate the premium for such a policy, an actuary will need
to estimate the likely cost to the company in present value terms. Using
statistics, the actuary would estimate the chances of survival till five
years and the chances that the policy holder will go on paying the
premiums for five years (that is, the policy is not lapsed). Using
economics, the actuary will decide on the discount rate at which the
future payments will be brought to the present value term (which is a
financial mathematics calculation).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Fundamentals of pricing</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Pricing
is an exercise to determine the right level of premium so that the
company makes the desired level of profit after paying for the claims
and other expenses on a portfolio of policies. So, an analysis needs to
be done on the past data to estimate the average claim payment per
policy. This analysis of claims data would be done by setting the
premiums at the different segment levels such as age, sum insured,
geographical area etc. The factors which may impact the premium (e.g.
age, sum insured, area) are called the &lsquo;rating factors&rsquo;. Ideally the
premium rates can be set for all the rating factors but many times the
actual premium pricing is limited to lesser factors due to market
considerations and other practical issues.</p>
<h2 id="example-11">Example</h2>
<p>Many factors play an important role in the pricing of an
insurance product. Age is the most important factor among them. If an
applicant is in the age group of 40 to 50 years, then the company will
fix a higher pricing for their policy as this age group people are more
prone to hypertension, diabetes and heart attacks. Similarly, location
is also important in pricing. For example, the medical services in Delhi
will be more expensive than other towns or cities such as Baroda or
Nagpur. Therefore, a person staying in Delhi will have to pay higher
premiums than a person staying in small towns or cities. In group
insurance policies, the structure of the group also plays an important
role in pricing of the product. The group which employs a lot of older
or experienced people will pay higher premiums than a group employing
college graduates. Similarly, if the company has more of women employees
and that too below the age of 35, the insurance company can price their
premiums at a higher rate as it may have to pay more due to maternity
and childcare costs. The following are the most important factors to be
considered while pricing a health insurance product: i. The cost of
paying benefits ii. The cost of administering the program such as
issuing policies, adjudicating claims, collecting premiums, filing
annual statements, etc. iii. The cost of marketing and distributing
policies that includes the commissions paid to agents and brokers. iv.
Companies also need to cover their cost of capital and maintain adequate
financial reserves in case costs are higher than expected.</p>
<h2 id="example-12">Example</h2>
<p>Administrative costs incurred by an insurance company are also
one of the major components to be considered in their product pricing.
The administrative expenses of an insurance company comprise cost
incurred in designing the product, advertisements, marketing, publicity,
employee&rsquo;s monthly salary, commission paid to TPAs and agents and other
daily operating expenses. These costs are also recovered from the
policyholders in the form of the premium paid by them. There may be
other considerations involved in pricing apart from the technical
analysis such as: i. Comparison with the competitor premiums for similar
products ii. Smooth progression of premium with age, sum insured etc.
iii. Cross-subsidy (one segment may have lower profit built-in compared
to the other segment) iv. Comparison of other products of the same
company v. Premium guarantees etc. IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE</p>
<h2 id="3-claim-reserving">3. Claim reserving</h2>
<p>Once a policy is sold by the insurance company,
meeting the future claim payments is the company&rsquo;s &rsquo;liability&rsquo; until the
cover is expired. This liability needs to be calculated from time to
time for internal management or statutory reporting. There are various
actuarial methods used for calculating the liabilities or reserving. The
claim management department sets aside a reserve for a claim the moment
it is reported. The actual claim paid at the time of settlement may be
more or less than the reserve. This claim reserving is done for each and
every claim on case-by-case basis. Actuary&rsquo;s role in the reserving
process is to estimate the incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim
reserves and to estimate the expected additional payments on the claims
for which the claim management department has kept the reserves.
Actuaries use the reporting delay pattern and the claim settlement
pattern to estimate these numbers.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Data and modeling</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>None of the
analysis above can be done accurately unless complete and accurate data
is captured in the company&rsquo;s database systems. For example to understand
that which disease is causing the maximum claims for a company, it needs
to capture the disease details of each claim. There are two sets of data
used by the actuaries: i. Details of policies and the insured members,
and ii. Details of the claims. There should also be a unique key using
which each claim can be linked back to the member which gave rise to the
claim. Modeling process is used to analyse the data and come up with a
formula which can be used to predict the future with as much accuracy as
possible. These models are simplistic formulae to understand the complex
real life behaviours. For example using the data a model can be built
which predicts the expected claim amount from a person of age 30, sum
insured 200,000 in Mumbai. There are various kinds of actuarial models
available which helps actuaries in predicting the future behaviour by
analysing past claims. A strong foundation of data is, of course, the
precondition to sound actuarial analysis and for setting the right
pricing and reserving structures for the health insurance business.</p>
