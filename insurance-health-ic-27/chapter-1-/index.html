<h2 id="a-meaning-of-health-insurance">A. Meaning of health insurance</h2>
<ol>
<li>Health insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>As we all are aware
that future is unpredictable and rather, uncertain. Any person can meet
with illness, bodily injury or any accident due to some unfortunate or
unexpected event at any point of time. A lot of expenses are incurred
due to such events like hospital stay, medicines, surgery, doctor&rsquo;s
visit and other medical expenses. Health Insurance provides coverage
towards all or few of such healthcare needs and medical expenses
incurred by a person.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Health Insurance is a way to distribute the financial risk
associated with the variation of individual&rsquo;s health care expenditures
by pooling costs over time (pre-payment) and over people (pooling).
(OECD 2004) This definition explains how the health insurance system
works. The health insurance insures an individual from expenses incurred
due to any variation in their health. It collects an upfront
contribution from an individual (commonly known as premium in the
market) and pools it over many people. Thus it works very similar to all
the other types of insurance in the market, the only difference being
that it primarily covers health expenses of an individual.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Commercial health insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The health insurance which is offered by insurance
companies is commonly known as Private Health Insurance or Commercial
Health Insurance. Commercial health insurance term is used to avoid
confusion between public insurance companies which are owned by the
government and the private insurance companies. Therefore, it will be
used interchangeably throughout this study text. Commercial health
insurance basically provides coverage to an individual towards all or
some of the health services defined under a contractual agreement,
health insurance policy made between both of them. For this risk
coverage, the individual, i.e. insured will have to make the payments in
the form of a premium to the insurer. The insurer, a non-governmental
entity, will in turn take up all or most of the risk associated for
paying all such health services which are defined under the policy.</p>
<h2 id="3-third-party-in-health-insurance">3. Third party in health insurance</h2>
<p>Health Insurance is different from
all other insurances such as fire insurance, theft insurance, home
insurance etc. In all other insurances, there are mainly two parties:</p>
<p>a) One is insurer who provides the insurance, usually an company, and</p>
<p>b)Other is insured, who is covered for likely risk to his/her life,
property or health.</p>
<p>However, in case of health insurance, there is one more party, the
healthcare provider in the absence of which it loses its meaning. It
plays a major role in the health insurance as it is the one who decides
and provides:</p>
<p>a)The type of health services to be used by an individual i.e. insured.</p>
<p>b)How much of such services are used</p>
<p>c)How much is the cost of those services</p>
<p>The involvement of this third party makes this insurance different and
complex too.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Ravi met with an accident while going to his office and had
serious injuries. He was hospitalised for five days in Gandhi Hospital.
He had taken a health insurance policy earlier. So, when he received the
heavy medical bills from his hospital at the time of discharge, he was
not worried at all. When he submitted his claim to his insurer, they
told him that it will take some time for them to get all the details
from his healthcare provider before processing his claim. The healthcare
provider, i.e. Gandhi Hospital in this case is the third party other
than Ravi (insured) and the insurance company (insurer). Gandhi Hospital
will provide all the details to the insurance company about the services
used by Ravi and the cost of those services which will become a basis
for the insurer to clear the claim filed by Ravi.</p>
<h2 id="4-health-insurance-market">4. Health insurance market</h2>
<p>Economists describe health insurance as an
&lsquo;imperfect market&rsquo; because normal market forces do not work as expected
in this case. The imperfections in this market are mainly due to the
following reasons:</p>
<h2 id="a-information-asymmetry">a) Information asymmetry</h2>
<p>The information available to
both insurer and insured about each other is either incomplete or not
completely transparent. The insureds mostly do not understand the exact
interpretation, meaning and coverage of their contact. Many a times,
they are also unaware of their insurer&rsquo;s capabilities of covering the
risk. Similarly, insurer is also sometimes not fully aware about the
likely risk to a person&rsquo;s health. So, they may also end up in pricing
the risk incorrectly.</p>
<h2 id="b-risk-selection">b) Risk selection</h2>
<p>For a health insurance, both the
insurer and insured will try to make the risk selection on the basis of
decision cost-effective to each of them. The insurer will obviously
select and insure the proposer with a low risk as compared to the one
with a high risk. This is also termed as &lsquo;cherry-picking&rsquo; or
&lsquo;cream-skimming&rsquo;. Similarly, the person with a higher health risk would
want to purchase health insurance more than a healthy person with low
risk. The insurer decides on the basis of acceptance and pricing rules,
which risks they will accept and at what price, through a process known
as underwriting. Underwriting is explained in detail later in Chapter 4.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>A person within age group of 20-40 years is less prone to normal
health risks as compared to a person aged above 50 years. Therefore, a
senior person will be more interested in taking a health insurance to
meet his medical expenses as compared to a young aged person who will be
more relaxed towards his health. This is also known as &lsquo;adverse
selection&rsquo;. On the contrary, an insurance company will be more
interested in providing a health insurance to a young aged person rather
than a senior person. Even if it will provide health insurance to senior
person, the premium will be quite high. This is because insurance
company is also aware that young people are usually less prone towards
any health risks as compared to senior people. So, it is less risky and
more profitable for an insurance company to provide insurance to the
young people.</p>
<h2 id="c-moral-hazard">c) Moral hazard</h2>
<p>Moral Hazard is mainly related to the insured and
sometimes also to the healthcare providers. There are mainly two types
of moral hazards: i. Demand side moral hazard: It works at insured&rsquo;s
end. A consumer with a health insurance will make use of and accept more
health services than he would have otherwise taken without any health
insurance. ii. Supply side moral hazard: It works at the end of Health
providers. They start suggesting and providing more health services as
well to more expensive treatment to the person having health insurance.
Various cost containment mechanisms are use by the health insurers to
minimise these moral hazards which will be discussed in the later
chapters.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>Mahesh, aged 28 years had taken a health insurance from a
private insurance company that provides for reimbursement of the
expenses incurred on health. He is normally a very healthy person. One
day he had some food in a party which resulted in stomach disorder for
him. Usually in such cases, he will take some medicines at home and will
take some routine care to recover. But as he was having an insurance
policy this time, he thought of using it by going to an expensive
hospital for check-up. He went there and the doctor there suggested him
to undergo some expensive tests and hospitalise him for a couple of days
for full recovery. Taking into consideration his insurance policy
coverage, he opted for the best room to stay in the hospital. He ended
up with a heavy amount of bill in the hospital which his insurance
company had to reimburse. Hence, this example clearly indicates that an
insurance coverage had made Mahesh behave differently, with less
consideration towards his medical bills which he otherwise would have
not incurred if he did not have any insurance coverage to pay for his
bills. At the demand side, Mahesh incurred more expenses towards health
services than required. Similarly at the supply side, doctor also
recommended more tests and expensive treatment than required due to
health insurance coverage of his patient.</p>

<p>Health insurance provides coverage for which of the
below? I. Accident II. Medical expenses III. Death IV. Disability</p>
<h2 id="b-purpose-of-health-insurance">B. Purpose of health insurance</h2>
<ol>
<li>Health insurance &ndash; a cover towards unpredictable illnesses</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by people
in India on their health is very high as compared to the other
countries. It accounts for about 71% of all health expenditure in the
country1,2 Due to this, individuals have now started taking lead in
planning for their own health expenditure especially when they can get
it at an affordable cost. Due to unpredictable major illnesses, an
individual may have to incur substantial amount of money from his
savings at a short notice. According to an estimate, every year around
2.2% of India&rsquo;s population3,4 is leading towards poverty due to such
illnesses. An illness may cause a potential impact on the finances of
individuals and their families resulting in a catastrophic risk. Hence,
people realise that the planning for their health needs and taking an
appropriate step to cover that risk is required. This resulted in
millions of people opting for health insurance policy to cover against
such health risks.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Health insurance products in India</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Health insurance products available in the Indian market are primarily
dominated by hospitalisation products, which mean that these cover the
high expenses incurred by an individual during hospitalisation. These
expenses are relatively high due to increasing cost of healthcare,
surgical procedures, new and more expensive technology coming in the
market and cost of newer generation of pharmaceuticals. With these
increasing costs, it is really becoming very difficult for an individual
even if he is financially sound to bear such high expenses without any
health insurance. Therefore, a health insurance is important mainly for
two reasons: 9 Providing financial access to healthcare providers in
case of any illness. 9 Preservation of savings of an individual which
may otherwise be wiped out due to illness.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-cashless-system">3. The cashless system</h2>
<p>The cashless system of providing hospitalisation
cover has immense value in terms of personal finances. It avoids the
need to arrange a large amount of money by an individual for payment to
the hospital, even if they were to be reimbursed or indemnified later by
the insurer. Thus, the cashless hospitalisation cover minimises the need
to keep surplus liquidity by an individual to meet any health
eventualities. The health insurance portfolio is now becoming the
fastest growing market segment for the non-life insurance industry due
to: 9 Increasing awareness among the people about the protective role of
health insurance, and 9 Improved focus on marketing of health insurance
products by the insurers. Still there is a tremendous potential for this
market as even today, only about 5% of the country&rsquo;s population has been
covered by a commercial health insurance product (excluding mass
government schemes).</p>

<h2 id="c-indian-insurance-industry---development-and-growth">C. Indian insurance industry - Development and growth</h2>
<ol>
<li>Early development of the Indian insurance industry The earliest mention of the
insurance system in India can be found in the research and writings of
treatise such as Manu (Manusmrithi), Yagnavalkya (Dharmasastra) and
Kautilya (Arthasastra). They refer about the pooling of resources that
could be re-distributed during the period of calamities such as fire,
floods, epidemics and famine. However, insurance in its modern form
first arrived in India during the early 19th century. Both life and
non-life insurance companies came to establish in India during this
period. The Indian Life Assurance Companies Act, 1912 was the first act
introduced to regulate the insurance companies in India. Later on in
1938, a new insurance act was passed to bring both life and non-life
insurance companies under a single Act. This act has been revised from
time to time, but does remain at the core of insurance laws for the
country5. The regulatory structure, as well as the constituents of the
industry, underwent several changes over the next 7 decades,
characterized particularly by the following sets of events which shaped
the course of the Indian insurance industry: a) Nationalisation of life
insurance industry in 1956 to merge number of private insurers into one
Life Insurance Corporation (LIC). Nationalisation of non-life industry
similarly in 1973 to merge number of private non-life insurers into one
General Insurance Corporation (with four subsidiary companies), all
owned by the Government of India. b) Establishment of the Insurance
Regulator based on a report by Malhotra Committee in 1994 on &lsquo;Reforms in
the Insurance Sector&rsquo;. Earlier interim regulator was established in 1996
which was later formed as a statutory authority in 2000. This resulted
in a new reform in the insurance industry. c) Opening up of the market
finally for a new generation of private insurers from August 2000.</li>

<p>2. Evolution and growth of health insurance in India6</p>
<h2 id="a-employees-state-insurance-scheme">a) Employees&rsquo; state insurance scheme</h2>
<p>Health Insurance in India formally began with the
inception of the Employees&rsquo; State Insurance Scheme, introduced vide the
ESI Act, 1948, shortly after the country&rsquo;s independence in 1947. This
scheme was introduced for blue-collar workers employed in the formal
private sector and provides comprehensive health services through a
network of its own dispensaries and hospitals. It is also supplemented
by services purchased from Authorized Medical Attendants and private
hospitals. The scheme is largely financed through a contribution from
employers and employees, which is supplemented by the Central and State
governments. The ESIS covers over 50 million beneficiaries as of March
20097.</p>
<h2 id="b-central-government-health-scheme">b) Central government health scheme</h2>
<p>The ESIS was soon followed by
the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), which was introduced in
1954 for the central government employees working for civilian
assignments. It aims to provide comprehensive medical care to employees
and their families and is partly funded by the employees and largely by
the employer (central government). In 2010, CGHS has a membership base
of over 800,000 families representing over 3 million beneficiaries8.</p>
<h2 id="c-commercial-health-insurance">c) Commercial health insurance</h2>
<p>The commercial health insurance was offered
by some of the non-life insurers before as well as after nationalisation
of insurance industry. It was largely available for the groups in the
beginning and that too for a limited extent. In 1986, the first
standardised health insurance product for individuals and their families
was launched in the Indian market by all the four nationalized non-life
insurance companies (these were then the subsidiaries of the General
Insurance Corporation of India). This product, Mediclaim was introduced
to provide coverage for the hospitalisation expenses up to a predefined
annual limit of indemnity with certain exclusions such as maternity,
pre-existing diseases etc. It underwent several rounds of revisions as
the market evolved, the last being in 2007.</p>

<p>However, even after undergoing several revisions, the hospitalization
indemnity-based annual contract continues to be the most prevalent form
of private health insurance in India today, led by the current versions
of Mediclaim. Even today, the other private health insurance products
are often termed by many people as &lsquo;Mediclaim covers&rsquo; considering it as
a product category rather than a specific product offered by the
insurers. Today, more than 300 health insurance products are available
in the Indian market, from more than 30 non-life, standalone health and
life insurance companies.</p>

</ol>
<hr>
<p>As per the
Constitution of India, the areas of Public health, hospitals,
sanitation, etc. fall in the State list. Thus, the States are largely
independent in matters related to the delivery of health care to the
people in their area. Each state has developed its own system of health
care delivery and created the necessary infrastructure. At the same
time, some items having wider consequences like population control and
family welfare, medical education, prevention of food adulteration,
quality control in manufacture of drugs etc. have been included in the
Concurrent list, where both centre and the states can issue legislation.
In addition, the Centre also supports key health sector initiatives
through National Health Programmes, particularly the National Rural
Health Mission, which are funded by the Centre and generally implemented
through the State machinery.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Government health departments</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The public health system exists at all levels of government: Central, State and
Local. However, in addition to the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, which is discussed in detail later in this chapter, it is
important to note that there are other important stakeholders in the
government system which have significant contribution and impact on the
health sector. These include: a) The Ministry of Women and Child
Development, which runs the nutritional support programme; b) ICDS
(Integrated Child Development Scheme); c) The Ministry of Chemicals
which regulates the Pharma sector; d) The Ministry of Labour, which
regulates the ESIS (Employees State Insurance Scheme) and also
administers the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY); e) The Finance
Ministry, which houses the Insurance division, the Ministry of Water
Supply and Sanitation; and f) The Ministries of Rural and Urban
Development, etc., among many others.</p>
<h2 id="3-public-health-system-at-the-national-level">3. Public health system at the national level</h2>
<p>The official &lsquo;organs&rsquo; of
the public health system at the national level consists of: a) The
Ministry of health and family welfare: headed by the Union Minister of
Health and Family Welfare. The union ministry has 3 departments: i. The
Department of Health and Family Welfare ii. The Department of Medical
Research, and iii. The &lsquo;Department of AYUSH&rsquo; (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha
and Homeopathy &ndash; earlier known as the Department of Indian Systems of
Medicine and Homeopathy- ISM&amp;H). b) The Directorate general of health
services: is the principal advisory body to the Union Government in both
medical and public health matters. c) The Central council of health: a
large number of health subjects fall in the concurrent list which calls
for continuous consultation, mutual understanding and cooperation
between the centre and the states. The Central Council of Health with
the Union Health minister as the chairman and the state health ministers
as its members, works towards promoting coordinated and concerted action
between the Centre and the states in the implementation of all the
programmes and measures pertaining to the health of the nation.</p>

<p>a) State Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare (or its equivalent, as nomenclatures differ amongst
states) is headed by the Minister of Health &amp; Family Welfare. The Health
Secretariat is the official organ of the State ministry of H&amp;FW and is
headed by a Principal Secretary or Secretary. The state governments
provide funds for primary, secondary and tertiary care institutions
(including medical colleges and their associated hospitals). State
governments also receive funds from centrally sponsored health sector
programmes. b) State Health Directorate: the directorate usually
consists of the State Director of Health &amp; Family Welfare, the State
Director of Medical education and the State Director for ISM&amp;H. The
State Director of Health Services or the Director of Health &amp; Family

<h2 id="e-health-infrastructure-in-india">E. Health infrastructure in India</h2>
<p>Health planning in India is an
integral part of the national socio-economic planning. The Health care
system in India is represented by some major sectors or agencies which
differ from each other on the basis of the health technology applied and
the source of funds for their operation. These sectors are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Public health sector</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>We have already discussed in detail about the Public
health system at the national level, state level and district level. The
public health system in rural areas is as follows: a) Village level: The
health system does not extend up to the village level in particular but
to implement the national health policies in villages, community
volunteers have been involved to serve as links between the village
community and government infrastructure. These include: i. The Anganwadi
worker (1/1000 population) who are enrolled under the nutrition
supplementation programme and the Integrated Child Development Service
scheme (ICDS) of Ministry of Human Resource Development; ii. The trained
birth attendants (TBA) and the Village Health guides (an earlier scheme
of health departments in states).</p>
<p>iii. ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) volunteers, selected by
the community under the NRHM (National Rural Health Mission) programme,
who are new, village-level, voluntary health workers trained to serve as
health sector&rsquo;s links in the rural areas. b) Sub-centre (SC)9 is the
most peripheral public health institution available to the rural
population. These have been established for every 5000 population (3000
in hilly, tribal and backward areas) and are manned by a female health
worker, also called the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and a male health
worker. c) Primary health centre (PHC)10 is a referral unit for about
six subcentres. PHCs have been established for every 30,000 population
(20,000 in hilly, tribal and backward areas). All PHCs provide
outpatient services, and the majority also have four to six in-patient
beds. Their staff comprises of one medical officer and 14 para-medical
workers (which includes a male and a female health assistant, a
nurse-midwife, a laboratory technician, a pharmacist and other
supporting staff). d) Community health centre (CHC)11 is the first
referral unit for four PHCs and also provides specialist care. According
to the norms each CHC (for every 1 lakh population) should have at least
30 beds, one operation theatre, X-ray machine, labour room and
laboratory facilities and should be staffed by at least four specialists
i.e. a surgeon, a physician, a gynaecologist and a pediatrician
supported by 21 para-medical and other staff. e) Rural hospitals: These
includes the sub-district hospitals called as the sub-divisional / Taluk
hospitals / specialty hospitals (estimated to be about 2000 in the
country); f) Speciality and teaching hospitals: These include the
medical colleges (about 300 in number presently) and other tertiary
referral centres. g) Other agencies: Hospitals and dispensaries of
railways, defence and similar large departments (Ports/ Mines etc). They
are also publicly funded but services are often restricted to the
employees of the organization and their dependents.</p>
<h2 id="2-private-sector-providers">2. Private sector providers</h2>
<p>India has a very large and heterogeneous
private health sector: which ranges from voluntary, not-for-profit,
for-profit, corporate, trusts, solo practitioners, stand-alone
specialist services, diagnostic laboratories, pharmacy shops, and also
the unqualified providers (quacks), each addressing different market
segments. In India nearly 77% of the allopathic (MBBS and above) doctors
are practicing in the private sector. Private health expenditure
accounts for more than 75% of all health spending in India. The private
sector accounts for 82% of all outpatient visits and 52% of
hospitalization at the all India level12. India also has the largest
number of qualified practitioners in other systems of Medicine
(Ayurveda/ Siddha/ Unani/ Homeopathy) which is over 717,860
practitioners.13 These are located in the public as well as the private
sector. Apart from the for-profit private providers of health care, the
NGOs and the voluntary sector have also been engaged in providing health
care services to the community. It is estimated that more than 7000
voluntary agencies are involved in healthrelated activities14. A large
number of secondary and tertiary hospitals are also registered as
non-profit societies or trusts, and contribute significantly to
provision of inpatient services to insured persons.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Pharmaceutical industry</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>India has a large pharmaceutical industry, which has grown from
a Rs 10 crore industry in 1950 to a Rs 55,000 crore business today
(including exports). It employs about 5 million people, with
manufacturing taking place in over 6000 units. The central level price
regulator for the industry is the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing
Authority (NPPA), while the pharma sector is under the Ministry of
Chemicals. Only a small number of drugs (74 out of the 500 or so bulk
drugs) are under price control15, while the remaining drugs and
formulations are under the free-pricing regime, but under the watch of
the price regulator. The Drug Controllers of the States manage the field
force which oversees quality and pricing of drugs and formulations in
their respective jurisdictions.</p>

<p>NSSO data suggests that over half of the household health expenditure is
on drugs, making it the single largest component of out of pocket
spending on healthcare. At the same time, drugs and supplies constitute
only about onetenth of the government health expenditure. It is,
however, to be remembered that the prices paid by Government for bulk
procurement of drugs is also much lesser than the prices of the same
drugs in the retail market. With the emerging changes in the patents
regime, there is a risk for upward revision of prices, especially for
newer drugs. However as of now, the cost of drugs is still a smaller
component of the inpatient bill due to which the commercial insurers in
India have still not focused their attention on controlling costs of
their pharmaceutical component.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>a) Health insurance insures an individual from expenses incurred
due to any variation in their health. b) Health insurance is different
from all other insurances as other than the insurer and insured, it
involves a third party, the healthcare provider. c) Health insurance is
considered as an &lsquo;imperfect market&rsquo; by the economists due to the reasons
such as information asymmetry, risk selection and moral hazards. d) The
out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by people in India on their health is
very high as compared to the other countries which resulted in more and
more people opting for health insurance policy nowadays. e) Health
insurance products available in the Indian market are primarily
dominated by hospitalisation products. f) The insurance in its modern
form was first arrived in India in 19th century after which regulatory
structure for the insurance industry has undergone several changes.
However, the Insurance Act 1938 remains as the backbone for all the
insurance laws in the country. g) Health insurance in India began with
the Employees&rsquo; State Insurance Scheme in 1948 for blue-collar workers
employed in the formal private sector and was followed by the Central
Government Health Scheme in 1954 for the central government employees
working for civilian assignments. h) The first standardised health
insurance product, Mediclaim for individuals and their families was
launched in 1986 in the Indian market. i) As per the constitution of
India, the states are largely independent in matters related to the
delivery of health care to the people in their area; therefore each
state has developed its own system of health care delivery and created
the necessary infrastructure. j) The public health sector in rural areas
