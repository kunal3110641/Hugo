<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter aims to provide you detailed knowledge
about underwriting in health insurance. Underwriting is a very important
aspect of any type of insurance and plays an important factor in
issuance of an insurance policy. In this chapter, you will get an
understanding about basic principles, tools, methods and process of
underwriting. It will also provide you the knowledge about group health
insurance underwriting.</p>

<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this Scenario</h2>
<p>Alex aged 37 years, working as a software
engineer, decided to take a health insurance policy for himself. He went
to an insurance company, where they gave him an application form in
which he was required to answer lot of questions related to his physical
built and health, mental health, pre-existing illnesses or conditions,
his family health history, habits and many more. He was also required to
submit many documents such as age proof, income proof and previous
medical records. Then they told him to undergo a health check-up and
some medical tests which frustrated him. Alex started thinking that he
is a quite healthy person and is earning also well, so why he has to go
through all this lengthy process? Even after going through all this
process and waiting periods, insurance company told him that high
cholesterol and high BP has been diagnosed in his medical tests, which
increases the chances of heart diseases later. Though they offered him
policy but at a very high premium, which he refused. Here, the insurance
company was following all these steps as part of their process. While
providing risk coverage, they need to evaluate risks properly and they
also need to make reasonable profit. If the risk is not assessed
properly and there is a claim, it will result in a loss. Insurance
companies try to insure people who will pay adequate premium in
proportion to the risk they bring to the insurance pool. This process of
collecting and analysing information from a proposer for the risk
selection is known as underwriting. On the basis of information
collected through this process, they decide whether they want to insure
a proposer and at what premiums, so as to make reasonable profit from
taking such risk.</p>
<h2 id="a-what-is-underwriting">A. What is underwriting?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Underwriting</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Health insurance is based on
the concept of morbidity. Here morbidity is defined as the likelihood
and risk of person becoming ill or sick thereby requiring treatment or
hospitalisation. Therefore, to an extent, morbidity is influenced by age
(generally being higher in senior citizens than in young adults) and
also increases due to various other adverse factors, such as overweight,
underweight, personal history of certain past and present diseases or
ailments, personal habits like smoking, current health status and also
if the occupation undertaken is known to be hazardous. Conversely,
morbidity also decreases due to certain favorable factors.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Underwriting is the process of assessing the risk
appropriately and deciding the terms on which the insurance cover is to
be granted. Thus, it is a process of risk selection and risk pricing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Need for underwriting</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Underwriting is the backbone of an insurance
company as acceptance of the risk indiscriminately or for inadequate
premiums will lead to insurer&rsquo;s insolvency. On the other hand, being too
selective or conservative will restrain insurance company from creating
a big pool so as to spread the risk uniformly. It is therefore critical
to strike an appropriate balance between risk and business thereby
maintaining the competitiveness and yet profitability for the
organisation. This process of balancing is done by the underwriter, in
accordance with the philosophy, policies and risk appetite of the
insurance company concerned. The job of the underwriter is to classify
the risk and decide the terms of acceptance at appropriate price. It is
therefore important to note that acceptance of risk is like giving a
promise of future claim settlement to the insured.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Underwriting - risk assessment</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Underwriting is a process of risk selection which is
based upon the characteristics of a group or individual. Here based on
the degree of the risk represented, the underwriter decides whether to
accept the risk and at what price. Under any circumstances, the process
of acceptance has to be done with fairness and on an equitable basis
i.e. every similar risk should be classified equally without any
prejudice. This classification is normally done through the standard
morbidity charts whereby every represented risk is quantified and
premiums are calculated accordingly. Further, unlike clinical protocols,
the insurance risk assessment is based on prognosis. Hence based on the
type of coverage, the classification is accordingly done. As we are
aware mortality usually comes much after morbidity does. Hence, it is
quite logical that the underwriting norms and guidelines are much
tighter for morbidity coverage than mortality. Therefore, the morbidity
premiums are usually steeper than mortality premiums and can increase
multifold based on the degree of risk.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>An individual who is diabetic has a far higher chance of
developing a cardiac or systemic complication requiring hospitalisation
than of death, and also health episodes can happen multiple times during
the course of insurance coverage. A life insurance underwriting
guideline might rate this individual as an average cost risk. However,
for medical underwriting, he would be rated higher. Therefore, the
morbidity premiums will be high and can increase multifold based on the
degree of risk. In health insurance, there is a higher focus on medical
or health findings than financial underwriting. However, the latter
cannot be ignored as there has to be an insurable interest and financial
underwriting is important to rule out any adverse selection and ensure
persistency in health insurance.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Factors which affect morbidity</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The factors which affect morbidity (risk of falling ill) and should be
considered carefully while assessing risk are as follows: a) Age: The
premiums are charged commensurate with age and the degree of risk. For
e.g. the morbidity premiums for infants and children are higher than
young adults due to increased risk of infections and accidents.
Similarly, for adults beyond the age of 45 years, the premiums are
steeper, as the probability of an individual suffering from a chronic
ailment like diabetes, a sudden heart ailment or other such morbidity is
much higher. b) Gender: Women are exposed to additional risk of
morbidity during child bearing period. c) Habits: Consumption of
tobacco, alcohol or narcotics in any form has a direct bearing on the
morbidity risk. d) Occupation: Extra risk to accidents is possible in
certain occupations, e.g. driver, blaster, aviator etc. Likewise,
certain occupations may have higher health risks, like an X-Ray machine
operator, asbestos industry workers, miners etc. e) Family history: This
has greater relevance, as genetic pre-disposition (e.g. asthma,
diabetes, certain cancers etc.) does impact the morbidity and should be
taken into consideration while accepting risk. f) Build: Stout, thin or
average may also be associated with morbidity in certain groups.</p>
<p>g) Past illness or surgery: It has to be ascertained whether the past
illness has any possibility of causing increased debility or impairment
and accordingly the policy terms should be decided. For e.g. kidney
stones are known to recur and similarly, cataract in one eye increases
possibility of cataract in the other eye. h) Current health status and
other factors or impairments: This is important to ascertain the degree
of risk and insurability and can be established by appropriate
disclosure and medical examination. i) Environment and residence: These
also have a bearing on morbidity rates.</p>

<h2 id="b-basic-principles-and-tools-for-underwriting">B. Basic principles and tools for underwriting</h2>
<ol>
<li>Basic principles of underwriting</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>What is not generally known to us is that in any forms of
insurance whether life insurance or general insurance, there is legal
attire interwoven with several principles of insurance, with common law
and with specific laws on insurance along with judicial pronouncements.
Health insurance is equally governed by these principles and any
violation of the principles results in the insurer deciding to avoid the
liability, much to the dissatisfaction and frustration of the
policyholders. These core principles form an integral part to any
insurance contract.</p>
<h2 id="a-utmost-good-faith-uberrima-fides">a) Utmost good faith (Uberrima fides)</h2>
<p>When one enters into a contract, in our case, an insurance contract, the same is
based on utmost good faith. In a contract both the parties are obliged
to disclose all material information which may be of importance whether
or not it is requested. Without utmost good faith, an insurance contract
would take the form of a wager or a gambling transaction. The insurer,
who undertakes to cover the risk, should be in a position to properly
understand the risk.</p>
<p>Any non-disclosure or misrepresentation of a material fact by the
proposer would make the contract &ldquo;voidable&rdquo; and the insurer can cancel
the contract. This is because the understanding of the insurer about the
party to the contract is different from what actually should have been
known for proper assessment of risk. Materiality of the information not
disclosed is judged by its relevance to underwriting of the risk. The
duty of utmost faith (Uberrima fides) has to be followed by the insured
as well as the insurer (when the latter is obliged to the insured once a
claim has been lodged under an insurance policy). The parties to the
contract must show abundant good faith, absolute and perfect openness
and honesty.</p>
<h2 id="b-insurable-interest">b) Insurable interest</h2>
<p>It means that a person should have a
pecuniary interest in the asset he is going to get insured and will
suffer financial loss in the event of any damage to such asset. Thus,
the principle of insurable interest is the legal right to insure and the
person taking the insurance has legally recognised relationship to the
object of the insurance. In case of health, we all are aware that the
greatest wealth or asset of a person is his own health. Therefore, a
person has a legal right to insure his health by taking a health
insurance policy.</p>
<p>Example Employers buy health insurance plans for their employees because
they are deemed to have an insurable interest in the health of their
employees in a pecuniary sense (which they lose by death, disablement or
sickness of their employees).</p>
<h2 id="c-indemnity">c) Indemnity</h2>
<p>Without the existence of
principle of indemnity, insurance would become a gambling transaction in
case of non-life contracts. The objective of the insurance is to
compensate the insured by placing him in the same financial position
after the loss where he was earlier; insurer pays nothing more and
nothing less. The insured cannot expect to get anything more than the
loss he has actually suffered. He cannot make a profit out of the
insurance contract. In contrast, life and personal accident insurances
are not contracts of indemnity but benefit policies. In a benefit
policy, the sum insured for the possible occurrence is paid no matter
what is actually spent. However, in an indemnity policy, one is usually
compensated for the actual costs or losses, only to the extent of the
sum insured. Therefore under the indemnity principle, the occurrence of
the insured event does not entitle the insured to compensation unless
the insured suffers a monetary loss.</p>
<p>Indemnity in all cases will moreover, be limited by: i. The sum insured
ii. Limit of liability iii. Deductible under the policy iv. Any other
cost sharing provisions in the policy Even in certain non-life contracts
the full sum assured is paid, if the assessed loss is equal to or more
than the sum insured subject to satisfactory compliance of the terms and
conditions of the policy.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>Ricky has taken a indemnity policy for a cover of Rs.100,000 and
has incurred hospitalisation expenses due to a minor accident of
Rs.40,000. In this case, he will be compensated for the actual cost
incurred, i.e. Rs.40,000 and not the sum insured, i.e.Rs.100,000. The
balance of Rs.60,000 will remain in his account which he can use for his
future coverage.</p>
<h2 id="d-contribution">d) Contribution</h2>
<p>These clauses are usually present in
all medical insurance contracts. These clauses apply when more than one
policy covers the same loss. In most cases each insurer&rsquo;s share of the
loss is based on the proportion that its insurance bears to the total
amount of insurance (&lsquo;rateable proportion&rsquo; basis).</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>Amit has taken two hospitalisation indemnity policies, one from
X company for a cover of Rs.250,000 and another from Y city for a cover
of Rs.150,000. Amit was once hospitalised due to heart attack and
incurred hospitalisation expenses of Rs.160,000. The total compensation
of Rs.160,000 was shared and paid by both the companies on rateable
proportion basis. The share of each company was as follows: X Company:
160,000 x 250,000 / (250,000+150,000) = Rs.100,000 Y Company: 160,000 x
150,000 / (250,000+150,000) = Rs.60,000</p>
<h2 id="e-proximate-cause">e) Proximate cause</h2>
<p>The insurer is liable only if the losses have been caused by the peril insured
against. The principle of proximate cause is applied to determine as to
whether the loss was caused by a risk covered, not covered or excluded
in the policy. The rule is referred to as &ldquo;causa proxima non remota
spectator&rdquo; which means that the proximate and not the remote cause have
to be looked into. If the cause of the loss is a peril insured against,
the assured can recover the amount of the loss from the insurer.</p>
<p>Another interpretation is that the proximate cause is the dominant cause
and does not have to be the first. We might describe it as the efficient
or operative cause. If there are several causes operating, the proximate
one will be dominant one or the most forceful one operating to bring the
result. It is the duty of the insured to prove that the loss was due to
the insured peril, which is proximate. Risks excluded are usually
mentioned in the policy under &ldquo;exclusions&rdquo;. If the loss is directly or
proximately caused by an excluded risk, the claim is not payable.</p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example</h2>
<p>Peter has taken a basic Mediclaim insurance policy for a cover
of Rs. 100,000 in the event of hospitalisation. One day he was admitted
to the hospital due to severe abdominal pain. After all the necessary
check-ups and tests, the doctor diagnosed that his liver is damaged due
to excessive alcohol consumption and he will have to stay in the
hospital for around two weeks for recovery. When Peter claimed from his
insurance company for the hospitalisation expenses, they denied for it
after analysing all the reports and causes for hospitalisation.
According to the insurer, the proximate cause for hospitalisation was
excessive alcohol drinking which was specifically excluded under the
contract; therefore it was not liable to pay any losses.</p>

<p>This document is the base of the contract where all the
critical information pertaining to the health and personal details of
the proposer (i.e. age, occupation, built, habits, health status,
income, premium payment details etc.) are collected. This could range
from a set of simple questions to a fully detailed questionnaire
according to product and the needs/policy of the company, so as to
ensure that all material facts are disclosed and the coverage is given
accordingly. Any breach or concealment of information by the insured
shall render the policy void.</p>
<h2 id="b-age-proof">b) Age proof</h2>
<p>Premiums are determined on
the basis of the age of the insured. Hence it is imperative that the age
disclosed at the time of enrollment is verified through submission of an
age proof.</p>
<h2 id="example-4">Example</h2>
<p>In India, there are many documents which can be considered as
age proof but all of them are not legally acceptable. Mostly valid
documents are divided into two broad categories. They are as follows: a)
Standard age proof: Some of these include school certificate, passport,
domicile certificate, PAN card etc. b) Non-standard age proof: Some of
these include ration card, voter ID, elder&rsquo;s declaration, gram panchayat
certificate etc.</p>
<h2 id="c-financial-documents">c) Financial documents</h2>
<p>Knowing the financial status of
the proposer is particularly relevant for benefit products and to reduce
the moral hazard. However, normally the financial documents are only
asked for in cases of high sum assured coverage or where the stated
income and occupation or vis a vis the coverage sought shows a mismatch.</p>
<h2 id="d-medical-reports">d) Medical reports</h2>
<p>Requirement of medical reports is based on the norms
of the insurer, and usually depends upon the age of the insured and
sometimes on the amount of cover opted. Sometimes, the proposal form may
also contain some information that leads to medical reports being
necessitated.</p>
<h2 id="e-sales-reports">e) Sales reports</h2>
<p>Sales personnel can also be seen as
grassroots level underwriters for the company and the information given
by them in their report could form an important consideration. However,
as the sales personnel have an incentive to generate more business,
there is a conflict of interest which has to be watched out for.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-2">Test Yourself 2</h2>
<p>The principle of utmost good faith in underwriting is
required to be followed by ___________. I. The insurer II.
The insured III. Both the insurer and the insured IV. The medical
examiners</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-3">Test Yourself 3</h2>
<p>Insurable interest refers to ____________.
I. Financial interest of the person in the asset to be insured II. The
asset which is already insured III. Each insurer&rsquo;s share of loss when
more than one company covers the same loss IV. The amount of the loss
that can be recovered from the insurer</p>
<h2 id="c-underwriting-process">C. Underwriting process</h2>
<p>Once the required information is received, the
underwriter decides the terms of the policy. The common forms used for
underwriting health insurance business are as below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Medical underwriting</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Medical underwriting is a process which is used by the
insurance companies to determine the health status of an individual
applying for health insurance policy. This health information collected
is then evaluated by the insurers to determine whether to offer
coverage, up to what limit and on what conditions and exclusions. Thus
medical underwriting can determine the acceptance or declining of a risk
and also the terms of cover. However, medical underwriting involves high
costs in terms of receiving and examining medical reports. Also, when
insurers resort to a high degree of medical underwriting, they are
blamed for &lsquo;cream-skimming&rsquo; and it reduces the number of people willing
to provide the requisite information and detail and to undergo the
required tests. Health status and age are important underwriting
considerations for individual health insurance. Also current health
status, personal and family medical history enable an underwriter to
determine presence of any pre-existing diseases or conditions and
eventually the probability of future health problems that may require
hospitalisation or surgical intervention. Further proposal forms are
designed in a manner to elicit information about past treatments taken,
hospitalisations and surgical interventions undergone, which help an
underwriter to evaluate the possibility of recurrence of an earlier
ailment, its impact on current or future health status or future
complications. Some diseases that the proposer may have been medicated
for earlier or is on medication presently may lie dormant for a while
and recur again.</p>
<h2 id="example-5">Example</h2>
<p>Medical conditions like hypertension, overweight/obesity and
raised sugar levels have a high probability of future incidences of
associated diseases of the heart, kidney and the nervous system. So,
these conditions should be carefully considered while assessing the risk
for medical underwriting. Current health status and age are key
underwriting factors for assessment of insurability of an individual for
health insurance. Since adverse changes in health status generally occur
post 40 years, mainly due to normal ageing process, insurers do not
require any medical examination or tests of the proposer earlier than
the age of 45 years (some insurers could raise this requirement to 50 or
55 years too). Medical underwriting guidelines may also require a signed
declaration of the proposer&rsquo;s health status by his/her family physician.
In the Indian health insurance market, the key medical underwriting
factor for individual health insurance is the age of the person. Persons
above the age of 45-50 years, enrolling for the first time are normally
required to undergo specified pathological investigations to assess
health risk profile and to obtain information on their current health
status. Such investigations also provide an indication of prevalence of
any pre-existing medical conditions or diseases.</p>
<h2 id="example-6">Example</h2>
<p>Drugs, alcohol and tobacco consumption may be difficult to
detect and seldom declared by the proposer in the proposal form.
Non-disclosure of these poses a major challenge in underwriting of
health insurance. Obesity is another problem which threatens to become a
major public health problem and underwriters need to develop
underwriting tools to be able to adequately price the complications
arising out of the same.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Non-medical underwriting</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Most of the
proposers which apply for health insurance do not need medical
examination. If it could be known with a fair degree of accuracy that
only onetenth or less of such cases will bring the adverse results
during medical examination, insurers could dispense with medical
examination in majority of the cases. Even, if the proposer was to
disclose all material facts completely and truthfully and the same were
checked by agent carefully, then also the need for medical examination
could have been much less. In fact, a slight increase in the claims
ratio can well be compensated for by the savings in the costs of medical
underwriting and other procuring expenses due to the increased
inconvenience in completing the proposal forms.</p>
<p>Therefore, insurance companies are coming up with some medical policies
where the proposer is not required to undergo any medical examination.
In such cases, companies usually create a &lsquo;medical grid&rsquo; to indicate at
what age and stage should a medical underwriting be done, and therefore
these non- medical limits are carefully designed so as to strike an
appropriate balance between business and risk.</p>
<h2 id="example-7">Example</h2>
<p>If an individual has to take health insurance coverage quickly
without going through a long process of medical examinations, waiting
periods and processing delays, then he can opt for a non-medical
underwriting policy. In a non-medical underwriting policy, premium rates
and sum assured are usually decided on the basis of answers to a few
health questions mostly based on age, gender, smoking class, build etc.
The process is speedy but the premiums are relatively higher.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Numerical rating method</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>This is a process adopted in underwriting,
wherein numerical or percentage assessments are made on each component
of the risk. Factors like age, sex, race, occupation, residence,
environment, built, habits, family and personal history are examined and
scored numerically based on predetermined criteria. The facts are not
easy to ascertain and prejudice may color the reports. Nevertheless, the
basis of the numerical system is logical; it gives a debit or a minus
score to the unfavorable aspects of the risk, and gives a credit to the
favorable ones. Some combination of debits is much more unfavorable than
their numerical summation e.g. Tuberculosis and underweight for
instance; heart murmur and rheumatism history; albumin and high blood
pressure. In such instances a supplementary debit for association is
added or the combination is treated as a unit and conjoined debit
applied according to known experience.</p>
<h2 id="example-8">Example</h2>
<p>In a numerical rating method, an applicant is assumed to start
at a point of 100, i.e. 100% of the standard risk. Then, according to
his built, family history, occupation, habits and other related factors,
points are assigned to each factor on the basis of rating manual. If the
applicant is suffering from any disease such as diabetes or high blood
pressure, he will get debit points for example 25 points, which will be
added to his standard risk. Similarly, if the applicant has an
occupation which is safe for any major health risks such as a professor
in university or a doctor, then he will get some credit points for it,
for example 5 points which will be deducted from his standard risk.</p>
<p>After considering all the factors, all debits and credits are added or
subtracted to reach the final rating. On the basis of such rating, the
applicant is placed under standard, sub-standard or uninsurable risk. In
the above case, it will be (100 + 25 &ndash; 5 = 120), which means that the
applicant is at an extra risk of 20% and the policy thus will also be
priced accordingly. Very often the impairments are inter-related calling
for the summation of only a fraction of each debit, and in many cases
the debit for one of the impairment can be wholly included in that of
another. On the other hand, the combination of certain impairments might
indicate a much higher extra morbidity risk than that suggested by the
simple addition of the debit for each.</p>
<h2 id="a-advantages-of-numerical-rating-method">a) Advantages of numerical rating method</h2>
<p>In a decentralised system of underwriting, the numerical method has
following advantages:</p>
<p>i. It ensures consistency between the decisions of different underwriters
and of the same underwriter at different times.</p>
<p>ii. It results in a more uniform treatment of risks because the judgment of
the individual medical selector is steadied and restrained by the use of
standards.</p>
<p>iii.The liability to error is greatly reduced by the detailed analysis to
which each risk is subjected and eliminates personal prejudice.</p>
<p>iv.The work of the medical expert or referee is much lessened because much
of it can be safely entrusted to the trained underwriter.</p>
<p>v.A more careful analysis of difficult or doubtful cases is made possible
because past experience with reference to the doubtful points is
expressed numerically in terms of a known standard and shadings from
that past experience either favorable or unfavorable may be more
intelligently made.</p>
<p>vi. Greater speed is possible in the handling of a large business, because
as much as two-thirds of the business may be passed through the hands of
the trained personnel without having it brought to the attention of
medical experts/referees at all.</p>
<p>vii. It facilitates the work of building new statistics. viii. It
provides a working rule to assess the combined effect of a number of
impairments which has stood the test of experience.</p>
<p>ix. Underwriting is practically reduced to application of a formula and can
be done by persons without any special knowledge of medical science.</p>
<p>x.While reviewing a case, one can easily see how the decision was arrived
at.</p>
<h2 id="however-there-are-some-deficiencies-of-the-numerical-rating-method">However there are some deficiencies of the Numerical rating method:</h2>
<p>i. It has not been possible to fix the percentage of increased claim
experience for all adverse features. Hence proposals with these features
have still to be referred to medical referee on the basis of special
reports obtained. ii. The assumptions that every adverse feature results
in a constant addition to the morbidity rate and the process of equating
the adverse with favorable features will give the net extra morbidity
are not always correct. iii. The fixing of the extra percentage for each
adverse feature is also arbitrary, though it is consistent. In many
cases, the rating manual only gives a range of debits (e.g. 25 to 50%)
against certain impairments but the actual rating depends on the
underwriter's judgment regarding the severity of the impairment and
other correlated aspects of the risk. Ratings have often to be modified
by taking into account the interaction of various aspects of the risk
and in particular the probable influence on the risk of the occupation,
habits, mode of living, socioeconomic status, moral hazard, etc. The
numerical ratings arrived can only be regarded as a guide but the
selection of risk depends to a considerable extent on the individual
judgment and skill of the underwriter. The main points requiring
consideration when imposing terms to cover an extra risk are firstly
whether the extra risk is of an increasing nature, decreasing or
constant; and secondly, whether it is likely to change greatly or not.
It should also be considered whether the extra risk can be covered
without an extra premium by some other means, e.g. by levying exclusion
for a stipulated period or for a permanent term of the policy.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Underwriting decisions</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The underwriting process is completed when the
received information is carefully assessed and classified into
appropriate risk categories. Based on the above tools and his judgment,
the underwriter classifies the risk into the following categories: a)
Accept risk at standard rates b) Accept risk at an extra premium
(loading), though it may not be allowed in some of the countries c)
Postpone the cover for a stipulated period/term d) Decline the cover e)
Counter offer (either restrict or deny part of the cover) f) Levy
permanent exclusion(s) under the policy</p>
<p>If any illness is permanently excluded, it is endorsed on the policy
certificate. This becomes an additional exclusion apart from the
standard policy exclusion and shall form the part of the contract.
Expert individual risk assessment by underwriters is vital to insurance
companies as it keeps the insurance system in balance. Underwriting
enables insurers to group together those with the same level of expected
risk and to charge them the same premium for the protection they choose.
The benefit for the policyholder is availability of insurance at a fair
and competitive price whereas the benefit for an insurer is the ability
to maintain the experience of its portfolio in line with the morbidity
assumptions.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Use of general or standard exclusions</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The majority of
policies impose exclusions that apply to all their members. These are
known as standard exclusions or sometimes referred to as general
exclusions. Insurers limit their exposure by the implementation of
standard exclusions. Examples of standard exclusions in most of the
health policies include: a) All disease / injuries which are
pre-existing when the cover incepts for the first time. b) Any disease
contracted by the insured person during the waiting period from the
commencement date of the policy. c) One-year or two-year exclusions
(waiting periods) for expenses on treatment of diseases such as
Cataract, Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy, Hysterectomy for Menorrhagia or
Fibromyoma, Hernia, Hydrocele; Congenital internal disease, Fistula in
anus; Piles; Sinusitis and related disorders are not payable until the
first or second year of the policy from the time of policy commencement.
d) War and kindred perils and nuclear weapons materials. e) Circumcision
unless necessary for treatment of a disease. f) Vaccination or
inoculation or change of life or cosmetic or aesthetic treatment of any
description, plastic surgery other than as may be necessitated due to an
accident or as a part of any illness. g) Cost of spectacles and contact
lenses, hearing aids. These may be termed as normal maintenance
expenses. h) Dental treatment or surgery of any kind unless requiring
hospitalisation.</p>
<p>i) Convalescence; general debility, run down condition or rest cure,
congenital external disease, or defects or anomalies, sterility,
venereal disease, intentional self-injury and use of intoxicating drugs
/ alcohol. j) Any treatment related to HIV, AIDS or sexually transmitted
diseases. k) Charges incurred at hospital or nursing home primarily for
diagnostic, X Ray or laboratory examinations or other diagnostic studies
not consistent with or incidental to the diagnosis and treatment or the
positive existence or presence of any ailment, sickness or injury for
which confinement is required at a hospital / nursing home or at home
under domiciliary hospitalisation as defined. l) Expenses on vitamins
and tonics unless forming part of treatment for injury or disease as
certified by the attending physician. m) Treatment arising from or
traceable to pregnancy, childbirth including caesarean section (can be
deleted; if maternity benefit is covered) and also voluntary medical
termination of pregnancy during the first 12 weeks from the date of
conception. The above list is not meant to be exhaustive. Also, it is
not meant to be specific to any one insurer. Each insurer will structure
its products in such a way as to offer an apparent competitive advantage
over products available from its competitors. Whenever more information
becomes available on the risks presented by the general incidence of
particular medical conditions; insurers will consider whether to add or
remove those medical conditions from its range of standard exclusions.
Such decisions are based on their estimation of the risks and the
ability to price the products accordingly.</p>

<li>Group health insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Group insurance is
underwritten mainly on the law of averages, implying that when all
members of a homogenous group are covered under a group health insurance
policy, the individuals constituting the group cannot anti-select
against the insurer. Thus, while accepting a group for health insurance,
the insurers take into consideration the existence of a few members in
the group who may have severe and frequent health problems. Hence,
excepting for group cover, if such individuals having severe and
frequent health problems were to be underwritten on an individual basis,
they would be construed either substandard or uninsurable risks.
Underwriting of group health insurance requires analysing the
characteristics of the group to evaluate its conformance with the
insurance company&rsquo;s underwriting guidelines as well as the guidelines
laid down for group insurance by the insurance regulators. Standard
underwriting process for group health insurance requires evaluating the
proposed group on the following parameters: a) Type of group b) Group
size c) Type of industry d) Eligible lives for coverage e) Whether
entire group is being covered or there is an option for members to
opt-out f) Level of coverage &ndash; whether uniform or stratified g)
Composition of the group in terms of sex, age, single or multisite
locations, income levels of group members, employee turnover rate,
whether premium paid entirely by the group holder or members are
required to participate in premium payment h) Difference in healthcare
costs across regions in case of multi-site locations spread in different
geographical locations i) Determining preference of the group holder for
administration of the group insurance by a third party administrator (of
his choice or one selected by the insurer) or by the insurer itself j)
Past claims experience of the proposed group</p>
<h2 id="example-9">Example</h2>
<p>A group of members working in mines or factories is at higher
health risk than a group of members working in air-conditioned offices.
Also the nature of diseases (thereby claims) are also likely to be quite
different for both groups. Therefore, the insurer will price the group
health insurance policy accordingly in both the cases. Similarly to
avoid adverse selection in case of groups with high turnover such as IT
companies, insurers can introduce precautionary criteria requiring
employees to serve their probationary period before becoming eligible
for insurance. Due to highly competitive nature of group health
insurance business, insurers allow substantial flexibility and
customisation in benefit designing of the group insurance plans. In
employer-employee group insurance plans, the benefits design is many a
time developed and deployed as an employee retention tool by the human
resources department of the employer. Often, the flexibility also stems
from the need to duplicate or improve on the existing &lsquo;richer&rsquo; benefits
already being provided in the existing group insurance plan by another
insurer, in a pitch to capture and shift business.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Underwriting other than employer- employee groups</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Employer-employee groups are
traditionally the most prevalent groups offered for group health
insurance. However, as health insurance gains acceptance as an effective
vehicle of financing healthcare expenditure, different types of group
aggregations have evolved. In such a scenario, it is important for group
health insurance underwriters to take into consideration the homogeneity
and cohesiveness of the group composition while underwriting the group.
In addition to employee-employer groups, insurers have provided group
health insurance coverage to varied type of groups such as: labour
unions, trusts and societies, multiple-employer groups, franchised
dealers, professional associations, clubs and other fraternal
organisations. Governments in different countries have been buyers of
group health insurance coverage for vulnerable sections of the society.
In India, governments both at the central and state level have
aggressively been sponsoring group health insurance schemes for the poor
e.g. RSBY, Yeshaswini etc. Though basic underwriting considerations for
such diverse groups are similar to generally accepted group underwriting
factors, additional aspects include: a) Size of the group (small group
size may suffer volatility) b) Differential healthcare cost in different
geographical regions c) Risk of adverse selection in case all group
constituents do not participate in the group health insurance plan d)
Persistency of members in the group IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE</p>
<p>In an effort to rationalise canvassing of group insurance by the
insurers to the mushrooming &lsquo;groups of convenience&rsquo;, the insurance
regulator in India has issued group insurance guidelines with a view to
rationalise the approach to be adopted by insurers in dealing with
various groups. Such non-employer groups include: a) Employer welfare
associations b) Holders of credit cards issued by a specific company c)
Customers of a particular business where insurance is offered as an
addon benefit d) Borrowers of a bank and professional associations or
societies The rationale of the group insurance guidelines is to restrict
formation of groups for the sole purpose of availing insurance with
advantage of of flexible design, coverage of benefits not available on
individual policies and cost savings. It has been observed that such
&lsquo;groups of convenience&rsquo; have often led to adverse selection against the
insurers and eventually high claim ratios. Group insurance guidelines by
the regulatory authority, thus, help in responsible market conduct by
the insurers not only in instilling underwriting discipline but also in
canvassing group insurance schemes and setting up administration
standards for group schemes.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use of genetics in underwriting</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>This is
a controversial application of the science of Genetics, but underwriters
of the future may be able to study the genetic information of
individuals for health risk assessment. Human DNA (Deoxyribonucleic
acid), is the &lsquo;blueprint of life&rsquo;, which contains the genetic
instructions used in the development and functioning of living
organisms, provides an innovative and effective tool to underwriters and
actuaries in assessment of the health status of an individual. Genetic
abnormalities can be broadly classified as inherited or acquired
(resulting from mutations caused by aging or the environment). Public
concerns about using genetics in underwriting relate to fears of denial
or cancellation of coverage by insurers on receiving an individual&rsquo;s
adverse data about his / her genetic composition and affliction.
Apprehensions are also raised about the privacy of genetic information
as this tells not only about the individual but also his/her family
lineage &ndash; both past and future, and its social and economic impact.
Further, extensive application of genetic information may also evolve
into &lsquo;cream-skimming&rsquo; by insurers in risk selection and underwriting of
individual health insurance risk. Until public concerns are suitably
addressed and safeguards for privacy of genetic data are put in place,
use of genetic information for underwriting of individual health or life
risk is presently not permitted in almost all global insurance
jurisdictions.</p>
<p>For instance, in Britain, for the time being, only one predictive
genetic test is approved for now to be used in insurance underwriting,
that of Huntington&rsquo;s disease for use in determining premiums for life
insurance policies over £500,000. This, of course, will be an evolving
area and will also be an upcoming task for insurance regulators to
comprehend and regulate.</p>
