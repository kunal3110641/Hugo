<h2 id="reinsurance">REINSURANCE</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>The chapter explains the concept and utility of
reinsurance in health insurance. Reinsurance is insurance for insurance
companies.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>A. Introduction to reinsurance B. Utility of
reinsurance C. Health insurance and reinsurance models D. Niche products
supported by reinsurers E. Criteria used to decide on reinsurance
programs</p>
<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this Scenario</h2>
<p>Reinsurance protects a primary insurer from
catastrophic losses and allows insurers to better predict and manage
their risk. Health insurers often use reinsurance to protect against
major medical expenses that can arise from, for example, someone needing
an organ transplant. Health reinsurance operates in the background and
doesn&rsquo;t interact directly with insured.</p>
<h2 id="a-introduction-to-reinsurance">A. Introduction to reinsurance</h2>
<p>Reinsurance is a risk transfer mechanism.
It provides a method for insurance companies to diversify their risks by
contributing a part of the premium received from customers to a
reinsurance company, and receiving the corresponding claims incurred
from the reinsurance company.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Reinsurance is the acceptance by one or more insurers, called
reinsurers or assuming companies, of a portion of the risk underwritten
by another insurer that has contracted with an employer for the entire
coverage. The diagram below shows the basic flow of premiums and claims
&ndash; between the customer, the insurance company and the reinsurance
company. Diagram 1: Basic flow of premiums and claims</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Reinsurance_101.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Insurance companies receive premiums from customers. This includes
premiums received from corporate customers for products such as property
insurance, marine hull insurance, marine cargo insurance, group health
and similar covers. They also receive premiums from individual customers
for health insurance, motor insurance, householders insurance etc. On
the happening of a covered event, insurance companies pay out claims to
customer.</p>
<h2 id="definition-1">Definition</h2>
<p>As the name suggests &ndash; &ldquo;Re-insurance&rdquo; is, at its simplest
level, - &ldquo;insurance for insurers&rdquo;.</p>
<ol>
<li>Quota share reinsurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="definition-2">Definition</h2>
<p>When the reinsurance contract is proportional to the original
insurance contract, it is called quota share reinsurance. In such cases,
typically a certain percentage of the original premium received from the
customer is paid to the reinsurance company and the corresponding
percentages of claims are received from the reinsurance company.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>In the case of a 30% quota share, the insurer transfers 30% of
its liability and premiums on every risk to the reinsurer, who must pay
30% of any loss sustained, whether total or partial. The percentage is
constant throughout and applies to premiums and losses alike.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Surplus share reinsurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>An alternative to the quota share reinsurance is where
all premiums above a certain amount is ceded (paid) to the reinsurer and
all claims above the same amount are received from the reinsurer.</p>
<h2 id="definition-3">Definition</h2>
<p>A form of pro rata reinsurance indemnifying the ceding
company against loss to the extent of the surplus insurance liability
ceded, on a share basis similar to quota share.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Excess of loss</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Both the above-mentioned structures work at a &ldquo;per policy&rdquo; level. A third
reinsurance structure &ndash; which is structured at a portfolio level &ndash;
exists, and is called an &ldquo;Excess of Loss&rdquo; reinsurance structure
(sometimes called a Stop Loss Cover).</p>
<h2 id="definition-4">Definition</h2>
<p>Excess of loss reinsurance: a form of reinsurance that
indemnifies the ceding company for the portion of a loss that exceeds
its own retention. In this structure, when the claims ratio for a given
block of business goes beyond a certain level, the reinsurer would be on
risk to pay for these claims.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>Consider the following: &ldquo;A stop loss cover, which operates
between 110% and 135% claims ratio&rdquo;. In this case, the reinsurer would
liable to pay for claims when the portfolio claims ratio increases
beyond 110%, and would continue to be liable to pay till the upper limit
of 135% of claims ratio is achieved. Beyond this level, claims would be
paid by the insurance company itself.</p>

<h2 id="test-yourself-1">Test Yourself 1</h2>
<p>Which of the following is incorrect with regards to
reinsurance? I. Reinsurance is insurance for insurers II. Reinsurance is
a risk transfer mechanism III. Reinsurance is a transaction between
insurance companies IV. Reinsurance does not require underwriting skills</p>
<h2 id="b-utility-of-reinsurance">B. Utility of reinsurance</h2>
<p>Reinsurance serves as a risk transfer
mechanism for insurance companies.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>A single event such a flood or an earthquake can lead to a large
number of claims for the insurer. This could result in a situation where
the insurer is subject to significant pressure on liquidity &ndash; and if
the claims are large enough &ndash; could result in the insurer having to
liquidate assets to pay for the claims. A reinsurance structure provides
the insurer with the ability to equalise claims pay-outs as well as
manage liquidity. Another dimension to the usefulness of reinsurance is
the fact that reinsures provides technical assistance &ndash; especially with
reference to pricing and underwriting complex risks &ndash; to insurance
companies. Sometimes, reinsurance is also viewed as the cost of
accessing these skills &ndash; especially in nascent markets or where a
market has been de-tariffed and previous pricing mechanisms may no
longer be valid. The final dimension to understanding the utility of
reinsurance is linked to the fact that in many markets, the use of
reinsurance helps an insurance company optimize the amount of capital it
has to hold for solvency purposes. This works as follows:</p>
<p>a) Reinsurance means that the risk of payment of a claim is partly or fully
transferred to the reinsurer.</p>
<p>b) For an insurer, the amount of capital to be maintained is linked to the
amount of business that it has written. When business is reinsured,
conceptually speaking, the insurance company has recourse to a reinsurer
for payment of claims. That means that, in theory, the insurance company
does not need to hold capital to the extent of reinsured business.</p>
<p>In practice, market regulations limit the extent to which an insurance
company can take this &ldquo;capital credit&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example</h2>
<p>In India, for health insurance, the prevailing regulations are
such that an insurer can get partial credit for reinsured business.</p>
<p>c) This capital credit argument is important &ndash; because the shareholders of
the insurance company would always want to reduce the amount of capital
used &ndash; so that they can maximise returns.</p>
<p>To understand how an insurance company will design and use its
reinsurance program, consider the following grid:</p>
<p>Diagram 3: Design and use of reinsurance program</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Reinsurance103.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>The grid shows claims severity &ndash; i.e. the average pay-out per claim on
the Y axis. For illustrative purposes this is shown from Low (&lt; Rs.
50,000 per claim) to High (&gt; Rs. 500,000 per claim). Similarly, claim
frequency is shown on the X axis &ndash; where claims which occur less than
1% per annum are classified as low, and those which occur more than 10%
per annum are classified as high. (Note that the scales are
illustrative). The grid shows the utility of reinsurance structures in
light of the underlying nature of the insurance business: i. Typically
claims which are low severity and low frequency are not reinsured. ii.
Claims which are medium to high severity and low frequency may be
reinsured. Usually, when an insurance company starts up business, it
would chose to reinsure this segment of business &ndash; because it would not
have built up enough reserves to be able to absorb adverse claims
experience.</p>
<p>Also, the typical structure used would be a quota share or a surplus
reinsurance structure. iii. Claims which are high frequency and high
severity would usually be reinsured. Usually such businesses would be
reinsured on a quota share basis (so that the insurer gets the benefit
of risk diversification as well as liquidity smoothing). iv. Claims
which are high frequency but low severity - typically such business is
reinsured only at a portfolio level &ndash; i.e. using stop loss type of
reinsurance structures. However, some companies may, in the initial
years, choose to proportionally reinsure this business, especially if
there is a risk of mis-pricing. In other words, if companies are not
confident of their ability to price the business (e.g.in situations
where past claims frequency (or incidence) data is not available or
considered flawed, companies may opt to reinsure this category of
business.) Now, consider a general insurance company which sells
property (fire - all risks), marine cargo, marine hull, health and motor
insurance. i. Typically, the average pay-out per claim for fire, marine
cargo and marine hull will be high; and claims frequency will also be in
the medium to high range. So it would be typical for these kind of risks
to be reinsured using a quota share structure. ii. For motor and health
insurance, claims pay-out will be in the low to medium range; however
claims frequency could be in the high range. Therefore, insurance
companies tend to use portfolio reinsurance structures such as stop loss
covers to manage the risks of these businesses.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-2">Test Yourself 2</h2>
<p>Which of the following claims are typically not
reinsured? I. High severity and low frequency II. Low severity and low
frequency III. High severity and high frequency IV. Low severity and
high frequency</p>
<h2 id="c-health-insurance-and-reinsurance-models">C. Health insurance and reinsurance models</h2>
<p>To understand how health
reinsurance operates, globally and in an Indian context, it&rsquo;s important
to appreciate the following aspects: Firstly, health insurance includes
the following product lines:</p>
<p>Diagram 4: Product lines of health insurance</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Reinsurance104.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="1-indemnity-health-insurance">1. Indemnity health insurance</h2>
<p>The insurance cover pays for the actual
cost of the health episode. In India, this product line is generically
given the name of &ldquo;Medi-claim&rdquo; &ndash; usually these covers have an average
sum insured of Rs.100,000 and they cover the cost of hospitalisation
episodes only.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Critical Illness insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>It covers not only the cost
of the ailment or disease but also the loss of earnings associated with
the same. The number of ailments / surgeries and disease covered are
smaller in number (usually 12 to 15 conditions) &ndash; but tend to be
clinically and financially intensive (e.g. Cancer, Heart Attack, Stroke,
Kidney Failure etc.). In other words, these are conditions which will
have an impact on the long term earning capacity of the customer; hence
the cover also pays for the loss of earnings / lifestyle associated with
the onset or diagnosis of the disease.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Fixed benefit covers</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>These are similar to indemnity health insurance in that, they cover inpatient
hospitalisations. However they pay a fixed amount &ndash; usually per day of
hospitalisation as well as a fixed amount for each category of surgery
that the patient undergoes. From the above, it should be apparent that
fixed benefits and indemnity health insurance covers would have similar
patterns of claims incidence. Pay-outs for fixed benefits are smaller
than those of indemnity health covers.</p>
<h2 id="important">Important</h2>
<p>Typical claims incidence benchmarks are in the 5% to 7% range
per annum (which also correlates with IRDA published figures for India),
and average claim pay-out for indemnity could be Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000
while, while for fixed benefits it&rsquo;s about Rs 10,000 to Rs 30,000.
Because, both these products fall into the high frequency, low severity
category &ndash; they are usually reinsured using a portfolio approach.
Critical illness products tend to have lower claim incidence (fewer
conditions are covered) but much higher pay-out per claim (this could be
as high as Rs 50 lakhs even in existing retail products). Therefore,
these tend to be reinsured using quota share structures. Another aspect
which is important &ndash; and specific to the Indian market is that in
India, health insurance products are sold by non-life companies, life
companies as well as Stand Alone Health Insurance (SAHI) companies. Each
of these three segments tends to use reinsurance differently &ndash; as shown
below: a) Life insurance companies: use quota share / surplus structures
for the Critical Illness Insurance that they sell. While some of them
have used quota share reinsurance for fixed benefit products &ndash; this has
been mostly at inception &ndash; and in order to obtain pricing assistance
from reinsurers. b) Non-Life companies: do not reinsure the indemnity
medical insurance product except with stop loss covers. The reason is
that, in the context of the other businesses that they write (such as
fire, marine etc.), they would not find value in basic quota share or
surplus reinsurance. c) SAHI companies: also use stop-loss reinsurance
covers. In addition, since these companies write only health insurance
&ndash; they would use stop loss cover with lower triggers than those used by
non-life companies. The final dimension to consider in the context of
health reinsurance is that in India, rural and social sectors are
increasingly looking at commercial health insurance as a delivery
channel.</p>
<h2 id="example-4">Example</h2>
<p>Most of the state governments subsidise the premium on rural
schemes covering specific segments (e.g. textile weavers, tea pickers
etc.).</p>
<p>In addition, the central government has also implemented the Rashtriya
Swasthiya Bima Yojana (RSBY) which is a social insurance scheme, which
covers the entire population of a given district for a basic level of
health insurance cover. Similar health insurance schemes have also been
started in various states. Rural and social insurance schemes may have
higher claims incidence than the &ldquo;mediclaim&rdquo; type of covers especially
if these schemes cover outpatient as well as inpatient treatment. At the
same time, the average claims pay-out is much lower</p>
<h2 id="example-5">Example</h2>
<p>The sum insured in micro-insurance schemes is Rs 30,000 or less,
which means that these products are one-third the average &ldquo;size&rdquo; of the
mediclaim product lines &ndash; it also means that the average claim pay-out
would be much lower than the mediclaim business. So, per se, there is
very little merit in considering any of the quota share or surplus
reinsurance covers &ndash; especially since the premium is subsidized by the
government. However, reinsurance has an important part to play at the
portfolio level &ndash; for example, a stop loss cover for the entire
government sponsored health insurance scheme portfolio would be useful
to the insurer to manage its books.</p>

<h2 id="1-employers-stop-loss-esl">1. Employers Stop Loss (ESL)</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, this is a stop loss
cover sold to large companies (usually with more than 50,000 employees)
where the reinsurer undertakes to pay for medical insurance claims
beyond the stop loss trigger, and may or may not offer administration
services up to the stop loss limit. These stop loss covers are also
bundled with third party administration (TPA) services &ndash;i.e. the health
insurance benefits for the employee are managed by a TPA (or equivalent
company). The main thing to note is that there is no insurance company
involved here &ndash; the reinsurance company sells its risk transfer
services to the corporate, and the scheme is administered by a TPA or
equivalent company. Large corporates often find that their claims ratios
are relatively predictable &ndash; and therefore they require risk
diversification only at the portfolio level &ndash; hence these structures
have evolved. In India, the regulations around ESL are unclear- though
it is likely that a corporate can purchase a high deductible cover,
which is effectively reinsurance, but from a direct insurer.</p>
<h2 id="2-white-labelling">2. White labelling</h2>
<h2 id="definition-5">Definition</h2>
<p>White labelling refers to a structure where the reinsure
designs the entire insurance product &ndash; i.e., pricing, underwriting and
claims management process, and the insurance company acts as a
distributor for the product. Usually, such arrangements are on quota
share basis. These are popular in some markets such as South Africa as
well as some of the South East Asian markets such as Singapore and
Malaysia &ndash; and they do provide the market as a whole with access to
products which would not otherwise be available.</p>

<li>Social reinsurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Social reinsurance is a variant of white-labelling in the context of
rural insurance. Here NGO&rsquo;s (Non-governmental organisations) play the
role of the distributor and &ldquo;outsource&rdquo; the design and administration of
the entire insurance product to an insurance company who effectively
acts as a reinsurer. In other words, the NGO provides access to
&ldquo;customer touch&rdquo; functions (e.g. sales, claims intimation, underwriting)
in a cost efficient manner. However the product design, controls over
underwriting and claims management are designed and implemented by the
(re)insurance company. These are popular in some of the African market
such as Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania &ndash; and these structures have evolved
in those markets since the local insurance companies do not have the
skills to design and price rural health insurance products and the
regulations also do not require that such products be sold only by local
insurance companies.</p>

<h2 id="e-criteria-used-to-decide-on-reinsurance-programs">E. Criteria used to decide on reinsurance programs</h2>
<p>An insurance company
will consider the following factors while designing its annual
reinsurance program: 1. Current size of portfolio and claims volatility:
the larger the portfolio, the lower the volatility and the lower the
inherent need for reinsurance. 2. The extent of capital &ldquo;credit&rdquo;
available from reinsurance. 3. The extent of technical support needed
from the insurer (sometimes insurance companies look at reinsurance
pay-outs as a trade-off to obtain the necessary skills) 4. Extent of
product innovation under consideration for the next year: if the company
plans to introduce new products where there is not enough clarity on the
expected claims experience, then reinsurance provides a valuable source
of risk mitigation. 5. Mandatory reinsurance requirements: many
countries have regulations which mandate that a certain amount of
business must be reinsured.</p>
<h2 id="example-6">Example</h2>
<p>In India, 10% of all business written by all general insurance
companies must compulsorily be ceded to the GIC Re- General Insurance
Corporation of India, which includes all health business underwritten by
them.</p>

<p>Which of the following factors are considered by an
insurance company while designing its annual reinsurance program? I.
Amount of premium II. Probability of claims III. Size of portfolio IV.
Estimate of profit</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>a) Reinsurance is a risk transfer mechanism. It is the insurance
for insurers. b) When the reinsurance contract is proportional to the
original insurance contract, it is called quota share reinsurance. c)
Surplus share reinsurance is a form of pro rata reinsurance indemnifying
the ceding company against loss to the extent of the surplus insurance
liability ceded, on a share basis similar to quota share. d) Excess of
loss reinsurance is a form of reinsurance that indemnifies the ceding
company for the portion of a loss that exceeds its own retention. e)
Utility of reinsurance structures: i. Typically claims which are low
severity and low frequency are not reinsured ii. Claims which are medium
to high severity and low frequency may be reinsured iii. Claims which
are high frequency and high severity would usually be reinsured iv.
Claims which are high frequency but low severity - typically such
business is reinsured only at a portfolio level f) Product lines of
health insurance: i. Indemnity health insurance ii. Critical illness
insurance iii. Fixed benefit covers g) In Indian market, health
insurance products are sold by non-life companies, life companies as
well as Stand Alone Health Insurance (SAHI) companies. The central
government has also implemented the Rashtriya Swasthiya Bima Yojana
(RSBY) which is a social insurance scheme, which covers the entire
population of a given district for a basic level of health insurance
cover. h) Some of the niche products supported by reinsurers: i.
Employers stop loss ii. White labelling iii. Social reinsurance</p>

<h2 id="answers-to-self-examination-questions">Answers to Self-Examination Questions</h2>
<p>Answer 1 The correct option is I.
When the reinsurance contract is proportional to the original insurance
contract, it is called quota share reinsurance. Answer 2 The correct
option is III. Claims which are high frequency and high severity would
usually be reinsured. Answer 3 The correct option is IV. Claims which
are high frequency but low severity - typically such business is
reinsured only at a portfolio level &ndash; i.e. using stop loss type of
reinsurance structures. Answer 4 The correct option is I. Life insurance
companies use quota share / surplus structures for the Critical Illness
Insurance that they sell. While some of them have used quota share
reinsurance for fixed benefit products &ndash; this has been mostly at
inception &ndash; and in order to obtain pricing assistance from reinsurers.
Answer 5 The correct option is I. Social reinsurance is a variant of
white-labelling in the context of rural insurance.</p>
