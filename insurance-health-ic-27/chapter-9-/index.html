<h2 id="health-insurance-fraud">HEALTH INSURANCE FRAUD</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter introduction</h2>
<p>The chapter introduces you to the insurance frauds
in healthcare sector. It discusses the causes and effects of fraud along
with its classification. It also deals with the methods to combat health
insurance fraud and IRDA&rsquo;s initiative to create fraud database.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>A. Frauds B. Perception cum causes and effects of
fraud C. Health insurance frauds vs. General insurance frauds D.
Consumer frauds E. Fraud mitigation F. Initiative by IRDA and the
industry &ndash; Fraud data base creation</p>
<h2 id="a-frauds">A. Frauds</h2>
<p>Frauds are present in any sector whether it is financial or
non-financial industry. People often hear about various types and forms
of frauds in different industries/walks of life. When it comes to
insurance, the fraudsters think very differently and identify various
loop holes in order to get a fraudulent claim. A very famous and
humorous incident that happened long ago will help the students to
understand the gravity of insurance fraud and how a fraudster cannot go
scot free for long.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Once a person purchased a box of rare and expensive cigars and
got fire insurance cover for his cigars. The insurance company also
understood the importance of the rarity of the branded cigar and insured
it with utmost good faith. The customer smoked the entire cigars within
a month and claimed to the insurer that the cigars were lost in a series
of small fires (which indirectly means that he smoked). The insurance
company refused to pay stating that cigar consumption will not qualify
for the claim. A case was filed before the court and court ruled in
favour of the customer stating that the insurance company did not define
in its policy as &ldquo;what is considered to be unacceptable fire and
acceptable fire&rdquo; and hence, ordered the company to honour the claim
(this shows the importance of policy wordings and conditions). The
insurance company honoured the claim as directed by the court. However,
after the customer cashed the cheque, the insurance company had him
arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and
testimony from the previous case being used against him, the customer
was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was
sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000 fine.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Health insurance fraud is described as an intentional act of
deceiving, concealing, or misrepresenting information that results in
healthcare benefits being paid illegitimately to an individual or group.</p>
<p>The main purpose of fraud is financial gain. However, it not only
creates a hole in the insurance companies' pocket, but affects all the
stakeholders. It not only invites higher premiums, but also leads to
restricted benefits, higher insurance co-payments; potential of denial
for future coverage, higher service taxes and also impacts the quality
of care.</p>
<h2 id="tip">Tip</h2>
<p>Various estimates indicate that fraudulent claims in the industry
could be anywhere up to 15 - 20 per cent of total claims. Health
insurance has even otherwise been a bleeding sector with very high
claims ratio. So, to make health insurance viable, there is a need to
focus on eliminating or reducing fraudulent claims.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-1">Test Yourself 1</h2>
<p>What is the main purpose of fraud? I. Financial gain II.
Lowering premiums III. Reducing claims IV. Lowering taxes</p>
<h2 id="b-perception-cum-causes-and-effects-of-frauds">B. Perception cum causes and effects of frauds</h2>
<p>It is unfortunate that
unlike frauds committed in other industries, insurance frauds are always
seen in the lighter sense by various stakeholders. The usual penalty the
person gets is the repudiation of the claim in majority of the instances
and this gives the strength to the fraudster to try his hand on various
Insurance frauds. Whether claim money is paid or not, fraud impacts the
insurance industry in multiple ways: 9 If the claim is paid, then it
affects the claim ratio and actuarial pricing which in turn affects the
reinsurance ratings and triggering more stringent underwriting norms
that may cause aversion among the genuine public to take policies with
the company. 9 If the claim is not paid,, it has multiple effects due to
spread of news about higher repudiations which in turn may affect
business and also the faith in the industry.</p>
<p>The below diagram highlights a picture of the fraud Diagram 1:

<p>Hence, the best part will be to nib the frauds in the budding stage
itself so that the business itself is not underwritten.</p>
<ol>
<li>Classification of frauds</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Fraud claims are wide-ranging, from
misrepresented services, services not rendered and services rendered to
'rented' patients, to a broad spectrum of revenue-enhancement
mechanisms. Frauds are commonly classified as follows:</p>
<h2 id="a-internal-and-external">a) Internal and external</h2>
<h2 id="i-internal-frauds">i. Internal frauds</h2>
<p>Internal frauds are those perpetrated
against an insurance company or its policyholders by agents, managers,
executives, or other employees.</p>
<h2 id="ii-external-fraud">ii. External fraud</h2>
<p>External fraud schemes are directed against a
company by individuals or entities as diverse as medical service
providers, policyholders, beneficiaries, medical consumable vendors etc.</p>
<h2 id="b-hard-and-soft">b) Hard and soft</h2>
<h2 id="i-hard-fraud">i. Hard fraud</h2>
<p>Hard fraud is a deliberate attempt either
to stage an event or an accident, which requires hospitalisation or
other type of loss that would be covered under a medical insurance
policy.</p>
<h2 id="ii-soft-fraud">ii. Soft fraud</h2>
<p>Soft fraud, which is sometimes called opportunity
fraud, occurs when a policyholder or claimant exaggerates a legitimate
claim. Soft fraud may also occur when people purposely provide false
information with regard to the pre-existing illness or other relevant
information to influence the underwriting process in the favour of the
applicant.</p>
<h2 id="c-provider-and-consumer">c) Provider and consumer</h2>
<p>Fraud can be committed both by the
insured member or the provider and at times are a concerted effort of
agents, brokers, insurance employees, insured member and the provider of
services and other stakeholders of the healthcare system.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-2">Test Yourself 2</h2>
<p>Which of the following fraud is also called as
opportunity fraud? I. Internal fraud II. External fraud III. Hard fraud
IV. Soft fraud</p>
<h2 id="c-health-insurance-frauds-vs-general-insurance-frauds">C. Health insurance frauds vs. General insurance frauds</h2>
<p>Motor and health
insurance are very prone to insurance related frauds. Documents such as
fake medical bills and certificates are commonly used to defraud
insurance companies in the country. These are followed by driving
license and FIR related papers. There is a perception among customers
that the insurance company pays less than what you claim even if it is
true loss assessment, which often motivates them to exaggerate their
claims. In Health Insurance frauds, it often requires cooperation from
multiple stakeholders to organise a fraud. Though it may sound little
difficult to get buyin from other stakeholders like Hospitals, but once
it is obtained, it becomes very easy job to lodge fraudulent claims.
These days various multi-dimensional analyses are enabled by the
insurance companies so that any fraudulent pattern is identified within
the least possible time. This enables to control the claims leakage in
the shortest possible time. Based on the pattern analysis, many triggers
are set to ensure that fraudulent claims are not paid. Some of the
triggers are given below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Triggers to detect fraud claims (only indicative but not exhaustive)</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Insurance frauds usually have common
profile and pattern. There are certain parameters which can be used as a
trigger to detect or analyse fraudulent claims or practices. They are as
follows: a)</p>
<p>k) l) m) n) o)</p>
<p>Treatment costs are usually on the higher side as compared to the
etiology. Costlier investigations carried out without justification.
Diagnosis of the ailment and the investigations done are not much
related to each other. Duration of stay in the hospital is more than
expected. Post-operative histopathology reports are not available
(surgical cases). Documentations are usually in perfect order. Higher
number of re-imbursement claims from certain providers. A pattern where
the treating doctor, agents, ailments are the same in many claims.
Medicine bills in serial order. Patient residence and the hospital,
chemist address, are not in same geographical location Short term policy
holders with lower sum insured. Higher per-patient cost in a hospital.
Excessive patients&rsquo; per-doctor in a hospital. Higher per-patient average
visit numbers. Higher per-patient average medical tests.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-3">Test Yourself 3</h2>
<p>Which of the following parameters can be used by
insurance companies as a trigger to detect fraudulent claims? I.
Costlier investigations II. Lower per patient average medical tests III.
Medical bills in serial order IV. Availability of post-operative
histopathology reports</p>
<h2 id="d-consumer-frauds">D. Consumer frauds</h2>
<ol>
<li>Categories of consumer frauds</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Consumer frauds
mainly fall in three categories. Diagram 2: Categories of consumer
frauds</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Health_insurancefraud_92.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="a-claims-fraud">a) Claims fraud</h2>
<p>Consumer claim fraud occurs when a consumer makes an
intentional misrepresentation in order to receive a benefit payment he
is not entitled to for such claims can be further categorised as: i.
False claims: For instance, maternity claims which are not covered under
the policy benefit and member is making a claim of hysterectomy with
fabricated medical papers. ii. Collusion with providers: Both provider
and the member collude to submit a false claim where the physician
receives benefits from the false claims. iii. Insurance speculation: An
insured applies for several health insurance policies without revealing
his/her other insurance coverage. Insured makes a claim from all
insurance companies. iv. Fraud rings: A group involving consumers,
agents, physicians, provider, making series of false claims IC-27 HEALTH
INSURANCE</p>
<h2 id="b-application-fraud">b) Application fraud</h2>
<p>This is committed when material misrepresentations
are made on an application for insurance with the intent to defraud.
Application fraud differs from claim fraud in that the perpetrator is
not seeking to illegitimately obtain a benefit payment-rather the
perpetrator is seeking to illegitimately obtain health insurance
coverage itself. Here, an applicant denies serious medical condition at
the time of taking the policy to obtain coverage that might have been
denied or excluded from the scope of coverage or to avoid additional
loading of premium. Another case is when the consumer is having
pre-existing disease, but does not declare at the time of filing a
claim. Also, in the case of corporate, changing the joining date of the
employee and getting an endorsement passed by the insurance company with
falsified records is an application fraud.</p>
<h2 id="c-eligibility-fraud">c) Eligibility fraud</h2>
<p>In such cases, the benefit is paid illegitimately because the beneficiary was
not truly eligible to receive benefits because of non-disclosure from
the insured. Eligibility fraud most commonly involves misrepresentations
of the status of a dependent or of someone's employment status.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>For instance, a member submitting claim of his siblings or
relatives or dependants, which are not covered under the policy or, a
business's group health plan covers all full-time employees but not
part-time workers. A part-time employee colludes with another employee
in human services to falsify records so that it appears that he works
full-time and is covered by the plan.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>&lsquo;Staging claims&rsquo; frauds</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="definition-1">Definition</h2>
<p>Staging of fraudulent claims is a long cycle wherein even the
person will not even be existing by a specific name at the specific
address. However, relevant records are created and the policies will be
issued. After a waiting period, claims will be lodged by producing fake
claim documents. In summary, all the documents will be fake and
fabricated to prove that the entire chain of claimed events is genuine.</p>
<p>However, Insurance companies have come up with various tools like
Underwriting Score Cards (which will rate the person based on the
profile, financial strength etc.) and also order for profile check
through field study wherein such persons are caught within short period
of lodging such claims. Apart from this, there can be frauds that are
committed during each stage of fraud cycle viz. a) Proposal to policy
stage b) Frauds during Contractual period and so on.</p>
<p>Though the intent of such frauds may not be to the extent of &lsquo;Staging
claims&rsquo; as the objectives of such frauds are different. Nevertheless, it
still needs strong vigil on the part of insurance company. 3. Stages of
insurance fraud(s) Insurance Frauds can be occurring into 3 broad stages
during the policy lifecycle: Diagram 3: Stages of insurance fraud</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Health_insurance_fraud_93.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="a-fraud-possibilities-at-proposal-and-policy-stage">a) Fraud possibilities at proposal and policy Stage</h2>
<p>Fraud is said to be
conceptualized and initiated from the time the person decides to take a
policy and signs the application form for insurance. Here the fraud or
misrepresentation can be in one or many of the following activities;</p>
<h2 id="i-disclosure-of-material-information-in-the-proposal-form">i. Disclosure of material information in the proposal form</h2>
<p>Insurance
contract is a contract of utmost good faith where it is obligation on
both parties to provide all information which is material to the
contract. It is therefore imperative that disclosure(s) of all material
facts is made to the Insurer. How a question is worded determines a lot
as to how information will be given. If you do not ask a specific
question, you cannot expect a specific answer.</p>
<h2 id="ii-disclosure-of-material-information-at-the-medical-stage">ii. Disclosure of material information at the medical stage:</h2>
<p>Normally Insurer seeks
additional information about the insured&rsquo;s health by medical examination
(with regular or specialized tests) which is done basis the sum assured
or age or if there is any adversity noted in the application form. The
medical information collected through the empanelled diagnostic centres
helps the insurer in identifying any adversity/abnormality or accurately
estimates the prognosis of the ailment thereby helping in pricing the
risk appropriately. The following disclosures have to be appropriately
studied so as to weed out fraud:</p>
<h2 id="disclosure-of-health-status-to-the-medical-examiner">Disclosure of health status to the medical examiner</h2>
<p>If the individual is suffering from hypertension or
diabetes unless the applicant discloses there is no way the medical
examiner would know about the same with mere simple medical examination.
Even further, if the person is on treatment with certain drugs, the lab
findings could still be in normal range and policy could be issued at
normal rates as there is no disclosure about these ailments. These
frauds potentially penalize the genuine policyholders.</p>
<h2 id="impersonation">Impersonation</h2>
<p>To avoid this issue, insurers insist the applicants to
carry a valid and authentic photo ID proof which is checked by the
empanelled centre before examination is done. This ensures that the
examination is done of the same person who has applied for insurance.
Additionally, sometimes proposals are introduced on fictitious names.
There are also instances of low premium policies being written on the
lives of servants and other known persons a close monitoring is needed
to detect such acts and severe penalties should be imposed when such
acts are detected.</p>
<h2 id="manipulation-of-testsrecords">Manipulation of tests/records</h2>
<p>In addition to the
manipulation done by agent or customer, even the medical doctors could
be a party to insurance fraud and provide manipulated test results so as
to suit the insured&rsquo;s requirement and provide policy at favourable
terms.</p>
<h2 id="iii-cash-defalcation">iii. Cash defalcation</h2>
<p>Another fraud which is most widespread both
at the proposal submission and at renewal premium payment stage is cash
defalcation. Though there are several measures being taken to restrict
cash transactions however no company has been able to arrest this
problem completely unless the decision to stop cash acceptance as a mode
of premium payment is taken.</p>
<h2 id="b-frauds-during-the-contractual-period">b) Frauds during the contractual period</h2>
<p>During the policy lifecycle there may be several transactions carried
out by the insured which could be:</p>
<h2 id="i-address-and-contact-details-change">i. Address and contact details change</h2>
<p>Here care should be taken if the contact details including the address
of the customer is changed just few days or weeks before the final
financial transaction (like fund withdrawal, claim intimation ) is done
or requested . The company may build additional checks before executing
the transaction.</p>
<h2 id="ii-sum-assured-alterations-ie-increase-or-decrease-of-cover">ii. Sum assured alterations i.e. increase or decrease of cover</h2>
<p>Any alteration to the risk cover should be dealt carefully and
ascertained that the same is initiated by the customer with appropriate
disclosures.</p>
<h2 id="iii-health-checks-undergone">iii. Health checks undergone</h2>
<p>Normally this benefit is payable via
refund of cost towards the health check undergone by the insured. Here
the bills and documents submitted should be validated so as to ensure
the customer has truly undergone the examination. These transactions
could vary based on the nature of product and permissible features of
the product. Here, appropriate process controls have to be built so as
not to misuse the system.</p>
<h2 id="c-claim-settlement-stage">c) Claim settlement stage</h2>
<p>Claim settlement is
the ultimate testimony for any insurance company and therefore larger
care is taken at underwriting stage so that claim settlement is done
with ease. Providing false/misleading information or withholding of
material facts at the time of applying for insurance; making a claim,
taking a claim/payment; making a claim for a health service not utilised
or making multiple claims for same loss/injury; altering / destroying /
fabricating documents/ records are all covered under this stage. The
various fraud scenarios at claim stage are:</p>
<h2 id="i-submit-false-claim-so-as-to-seek-benefit">i. Submit false claim so as to seek benefit</h2>
<p>Since it involves payment of benefits of the policy
holder monies, care has to be taken to ensure that the transaction is
done ensuring all checks and controls.</p>
<h2 id="ii-provide-erroneous-address-to-claim-benefit">ii. Provide erroneous address to claim benefit</h2>
<p>The type of fraud is done by siphoning the policyholder&rsquo;s
money where the address is changed just before the claim is intimated.
This will ensure that the claim benefit is now being sent at the new
address without the actual beneficiary being aware about the same. To
control such incidences, there are checks which the companies have put
in place and important one being KYC document check before the payment
is made to beneficiary.</p>
<h2 id="iii-inflation-of-medical-bills-extended-los">iii. Inflation of medical bills/ extended LOS</h2>
<p>This is the most common fraud in health insurance. Here, because of the
strong nexus between the provider and the customer often the insurance
company is unable to manage/control this fraud.</p>
<p>The reason being: The nature of documentation is quite appropriate for
the treatment given;  The tariff charts for hospital are not well
defined/ published and  There is good amount of subjectivity in
defining the medical necessity/protocol It is due to these challenges,
it has become quite difficult for the insurer to control and identify
this behaviour. To sum up, health insurance fraud can be committed at
various points in the claim transaction by different parties inclusive
of claimants, policyholders, third-party claimants and the professionals
who provide services to claimants. The following are the some of the
instances of fraud in health insurance.</p>
<p>Diagram 4: Instances of fraud</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Health_insurance_fraud_94.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-4">Test Yourself 4</h2>
<p>A category of consumer claim fraud in which a group
involving consumers, agents, physicians, provider etc. make a false
claim will be categorised as ________. I. False claims II.
Collusion with providers III. Insurance speculation IV. Fraud rings</p>
<h2 id="e-fraud-mitigation">E. Fraud mitigation</h2>
<p>It takes a concerted team effort to fight insurance
frauds. No individual, organisation or agency has the resources to
single-handedly stop all insurance frauds. Today, the situation is such
that if a claim is found to be fraudulent, the insurer just repudiates
the same. It does not go beyond that point as its financial liability is
eliminated. The unfortunate reality is the fraudster goes scot free and
continues this practice with another insurer and the vicious cycle keeps
repeating. Fraud detection mechanisms have to be robust and effective in
eliminating any attempt to defraud the company. It is not easy for an
organisation to deny liability which occurs during the policy life
cycle, especially when appropriate assessments / validations could have
been done at policy inception stage. Table 9.1 Human interface / process

<p>The fraud in insurance can be combated through the following combined
efforts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human interface or process improvisation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-creation-of-fraud-data-base">a) Creation of fraud data base</h2>
<p>This provides Information on frauds (comprising of
agents; providers; doctors; customers) not only serves as a powerful
tool at the claim settlement stage but also at the time of underwriting.
Such a data base must host all information about frauds or suspicious
transactions across all insurance companies. In fact, the same should be
extended and integrated with other financial service institutions.
However, all frauds cannot be identified or picked only basis data
analysis. Therefore organisations should use more than one form of
techniques/measures to identify and control frauds.</p>
<h2 id="b-create-consumer-awareness">b) Create consumer awareness</h2>
<p>The biggest battle to be won is that of educating the insuring
public on the evils of insurance fraud and ways to prevent it. A
sustained campaign, similar to the ones released by the IT department to
combat tax evasion or by RBI on not sharing your internet banking
passwords, would be required to sensitize the average insured towards
this issue. It is only when insurance fraud is regarded as something
'shameful' and 'criminal' by a large section of public; all other
efforts will begin to bear fruit.</p>
<h2 id="c-robust-whistle-blow-policy">c) Robust whistle blow policy</h2>
<p>As a sequel to building awareness, insurers and the regulator should actively
encourage &quot;whistle-blow policy&quot; or just plain &quot;squealing&quot; on
fraudsters. This shall not only protect the industry and consumers
towards fraud but also penalize the ones involved in doing those.</p>
<h2 id="d-effective-legislation-and-judicial-action">d) Effective legislation and judicial action</h2>
<p>Insurance fraud deserves
special legislation and judicial attention - a few quick, high-profile
and highly publicised convictions are probably the strongest medicine
for potential fraudsters. Without legislative and judicial support, all
the activism of insurers and regulators will be rendered toothless.</p>
<h2 id="e-fraud-management-philosophy-and-policy">e) Fraud management philosophy and policy</h2>
<p>Company should have a &ldquo;Zero
tolerance&rdquo; towards fraud and fraudsters. On an internal level, companies
will require to have a well laid out policy which makes clear that fraud
will not be tolerated. They will also need to have internal measures to
detect, investigate and prevent fraud - or have a Fraud Plan.</p>
<h2 id="f-robust-investigation-unit-and-mystery-shopping">f) Robust investigation unit and mystery shopping</h2>
<p>Companies should create
dedicated risk control units who should promptly investigate on all
frauds and suspicious transactions discreetly.</p>
<h2 id="g-doctor-seeding">g) Doctor seeding</h2>
<p>This is nothing but the mystery shopping with respect to the Diagnostic centres
and Doctors wherein the seed (investigator) will disguise himself as a
patient and will tell that he suffers from various diseases and ask the
doctor to give a clean chit in the Medical Examination form of the
Insurance application form. Based on the reactions of the doctor, the
actions will be taken on the doctors and also the previously medical
examined cases by the Doctor.</p>
<h2 id="h-training-and-communication">h) Training and communication</h2>
<p>Organisation must adequately invest in creating sensitivity on this subject. The
training and communication should be done as a part of induction or
monthly newsletters for all its stakeholders (i.e. employees, customer,
intermediaries, partners and shareholders) and must cover various frauds
scenarios, its prevention, and also provide action matrix for
fraudsters. This way the company must create a fear factor in the minds
of the people and create a strong deterrent.</p>
<h2 id="i-welcome-calling">i) Welcome calling</h2>
<p>Customer after receiving the policies can be given a welcome call and the
untraceable numbers checked through field visits to verify the
authenticity of the address and for the presence of any bogus customers.</p>
<h2 id="j-plugging-process-gaps-quickly">j) Plugging process gaps quickly</h2>
<p>Fraud if not identified can spread like
a communicable disease and leaves with a far bigger impact for the
organization. Hence the golden rule should, if one identifies fraud,
plug it immediately before it is too late and ensure adequate control
are taken for it not to be repeated in further.</p>
<h2 id="k-control-business-where-fraud-is-not-manageable">k) Control business where fraud is not manageable</h2>
<p>This is not what many
organisations want to accept or follow. If all the processes or control
measures fail to curb fraud then a call needs to be taken to stop doing
business in that format.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>For example, if cash as a mode of payment is leading to many
cash defalcations, then cash as a payment mode should be stopped, if a
particular geography or area is raising many fraudulent claims, company
may take call to stop sourcing policies from there.</p>
<h2 id="l-feedback-to-entities-who-are-party-to-fraud">l) Feedback to entities who are party to fraud</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is difficult to ascertain
fraud or confirm whether the party involved has done the same with a
fraudulent intent. Therefore the company must investigates the matter
and provide appropriate warning to all parties concerned/involved. This
shall ensure effective control and sensitisation from a future
perspective. Many of the companies also have the &lsquo;penal action matric&rsquo;
which conveys the list of disciplinary actions taken against the
employees for various types of fraud. These are agreed and signed by the
employees as well before joining the insurance company. Insurance fraud
is a serious issue that insurance companies, law enforcement agencies
and the industry regulator are confronted with. As health insurance
business is growing fast, leading to an increase in magnitude,
complexity and variety of frauds. To tackle the menace, insurers,
regulators and enforcement agencies all need to work together to
minimise the ill effects of fraud on the entire Industry.</p>

<li>Technology &amp; process interface</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>As we know, If a fraud is not picked on a real time
basis then there is a fear for organization to become a soft target
against these frauds. In order to safeguard against the fraudsters,
technology and processes play an important part and some of the key
characteristics for an effective and efficient fraud management system
should be:</p>
<h2 id="a-ease-of-data-capture">a) Ease of data capture</h2>
<p>It is extremely critical that the
claim system is easy to navigate and user friendly for all stakeholders.
The reason being, if complete claims data is not available, then the
system will not be able to display fraud triggers/alerts effectively
thereby making it difficult for the claim assessors to detect frauds.</p>
<h2 id="b-comprehensive-claims-information">b) Comprehensive claims information</h2>
<p>To ensure robust fraud management
and pick up relevant fraud alerts, the system should have comprehensive
data fields. Importantly to avoid problems of poor data quality, system
must have effective validations for data consistency check.</p>
<h2 id="c-ability-to-detect-fraud-effectively">c) Ability to detect fraud effectively</h2>
<p>In order to successfully prevent fraud, the
methods or logic deployed should be able to provide fast results. The
system should be able to detect frauds based on the rules and logic
defined to identify various frauds. Few examples of various frauds which
the system should be able to easily identify are: i. Adverse claim ratio
for an agent or partner or group ii. Adverse claim ratio for a given
profile/ occupation/ income group iii. Higher LOS ( length of stay) for
a given ailment iv. Higher treatment cost for a given ailment</p>
<h2 id="d-extract-data-output-in-a-desirable-or-actionable-format">d) Extract data output in a desirable or actionable format</h2>
<p>This is an important
activity as all the data captured should be available to the management
in a desirable format with all possible data cuts thereby making it
easier for decision making and regulatory reporting.</p>
<h2 id="e-rag-red-amber-green-analysis">e) RAG (Red, Amber, Green) analysis</h2>
<p>The entities that provide business are analysed on
periodic basis and the worst performers in terms of claims (related to
Hospitals, Agents, Diagnostic Centres) are assigned Red rating, mediocre
performance are given Amber and positive results are assigned Green
through statistical analysis and segment classification mechanisms. The
Red category are continuously monitored and counselled to take actions
accordingly including but not limited to Termination.</p>
<h2 id="f-propensity-modelling">f) Propensity modelling</h2>
<p>Propensity modelling aims at identifying the potential
fraudsters based on the past experience, backed by data analytics such
that the business coming through the proper channel are kept on high
alert so that fraudulent business is not entering the company books.
Many a times, the insurance company&rsquo;s system itself picks up the cases
without any whistle blowing.</p>
<p>Very importantly, based on such proactive sampling investigations, even
the issued policies are cancelled on suo-moto basis backed by the Sec.45
of the Insurance Act.</p>
<h2 id="g-underwriting--claims-rules-engine--business-process-transformations">g) Underwriting / claims rules engine &amp; business process transformations</h2>
<p>These days most of the underwriting rules and
claims rules are built up in the system through various rules such that
80% of the generic and genuine claims are processed automatically. This
leaves sufficient time for the expert claims managers to analyse the
complex and high claim cases. Business Process Transformation (BPT)
tools also enable the insurers to make quick changes in the rules.</p>
<h2 id="h-fraud-investigations">h) Fraud investigations</h2>
<p>A specialised community has emerged within the
insurance sector with knowledge about various types of frauds that are
happening and also various new methods of investigations that are
implemented to crack the frauds. This also reduces the life of the
frauds cycle and also helps to include stricter underwriting and claim
rules.</p>
<h2 id="i-vigilance-compliance-checks">i) Vigilance, compliance checks</h2>
<p>Vigilance checks, surprise audits
are often conducted by the company and based on the findings, actions
are taken accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="j-audits">j) Audits</h2>
<p>Frauds are also identified through
various types of Audits conducted by Internal Audit, Risk Audit &amp;
External Audit departments.</p>
<h2 id="k-enterprise-risks-and-internal-controls">k) Enterprise risks and internal controls</h2>
<p>Similarly Enterprise Risks &amp; Internal Controls department oversees all
the processes of the company in a comprehensive manner and check whether
all the processes are available in an integrated manner. The departments
continuously receive input from the various stakeholders and the market
intelligence and ensure that the process gaps are integrated and
plugged. Internal Controls function also ensures that the processes are
adhered and implemented by the respective stakeholders.</p>
<h2 id="l-controls-through-insurance-covers">l) Controls through insurance covers</h2>
<p>General Insurance industry also
offers various coverage&rsquo;s against the frauds like Fidelity Guarantee
covers etc. which many of the insurance companies have availed to
minimise the loss due to employee related frauds. Similarly various
specialised tailor made covers are also available. Insurance companies
include this as an important process to safeguard themselves to certain
extent.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-5">Test Yourself 5</h2>
<p>In RAG analysis, which category are continuously
monitored and counselled to take actions accordingly including but not
limited to termination? I. Red category II. Amber category III. Green
category IV. All Red, Amber and Green categories</p>
<h2 id="f-initiative-by-irda-and-the-industry----fraud-data-base-creation">F. Initiative by IRDA and the industry &ndash; Fraud data base creation</h2>
<p>After
banks, it&rsquo;s the turn of the insurance industry to build a customer
information database that will check frauds and enable pricing of
products based on individual profiles. The insurance regulator has
itself set up a policyholder information database &mdash; Insurance
Information Bureau. The database could provide output on the lines of
the Credit Information Bureau which caters to the banking industry. The
objective would be to maintain a database of all insured vehicles and
health insurance details to facilitate more efficient underwriting. Just
as banks can determine the creditworthiness of an individual by querying
the Credit Information Bureau of India (CIBIL), insurers in future may
be able to get details of an individual&rsquo;s insurance history and his
claims records whenever they get a new proposal. An online database
would enable an insurance company to verify whether an individual has a
good insurance track record or not. Insurers may also co-operate among
themselves to create common mechanisms to combat fraud and to share
information on fraudulent entities in the system.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>a) Health insurance fraud is described as an intentional act of
deceiving, concealing, or misrepresenting information that results in
healthcare benefits being paid illegitimately to an individual or group.
b) Whether claim money is paid or not, the insurance industry has its
impacts in various dimensions with respect to fraud. 9 If the claim is
paid, then it affects the claim ratio, chargeable premium and actuarial
pricing which in turn affects the reinsurance ratings and triggering
more stringent underwriting norms that may cause aversion among the
genuine public to take policies with the company. 9 Similarly if the
claim is not paid also, it has multiple effects due to spread of news
regarding higher repudiations which in turn may affect business and also
the faith in the industry. c) Frauds are classified as: 9 Internal and
external 9 Hard and soft 9 Provider and consumer d) Motor and health
insurance are very much prone to insurance related frauds. In health
insurance frauds, it often requires co-operation from multiple
stakeholders to organise a fraud. e) Consumer frauds are mainly
categorised in three categories: 9 Claims fraud: when a consumer makes
an intentional misrepresentation in order to receive a benefit payment
he is not entitled to for such claims 9 Application fraud: committed
when material misrepresentations are made on an application for
insurance with the intent to defraud 9 Eligibility fraud: most commonly
involves misrepresentations of the status of a dependent or of
someone's employment status f) Staging of fraudulent claims is a long
cycle wherein even there will be no person existing by a specific name
at the specific address. g) Insurance frauds can be occurring into 3
broad stages during the policy lifecycle: 9 Fraud possibilities at
proposal and policy stage 9 Frauds during the contractual period 9
Frauds at claim settlement stage</p>
<p>h) The fraud in insurance can be combated through the following
combined efforts: 9 Human interface or process improvisation 9
Technology and process interface i) Doctor seeding is the mystery
shopping with respect to the diagnostic centres and doctors wherein the
seed (investigator) will disguise himself as a patient and will tell
that he suffers from various diseases and ask the doctor to give a clean
chit in the medical examination category of the insurance application
form. j) The insurance regulator has set up a policyholder information
database &mdash; Insurance Information Bureau (IIB). The database could
provide output on the lines of the Credit Information Bureau which
caters to the banking industry.</p>
