<h2 id="health-insurance-products-in-india">HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS IN INDIA</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter aims to provide knowledge about the
most common and popular insurance products available in the Indian
market and the coverage and characteristics of each of these products.
We will also discuss the new innovative health insurance products coming
up in the Indian market.</p>
<p>Learning Outcomes A. Attributes of Indian health insurance products B.
Innovative health insurance products in India</p>
<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this Scenario</h2>
<p>In India, the health insurance sector has
undergone many changes up until the opening of the market for private
insurance companies in 2001. By the end of 2009, there were over 30
insurers (including non-life insurers, standalone health insurers and
life insurers) which were together offering more than 300 different
products, though most of them being hospitalisation indemnity
procedures. But with increasing competition in the market, insurers are
now coming up with a new variety of coverage of items and innovative
products to fulfill the needs of various sections of the population.
More and more people are now looking for and opting for health insurance
products to secure themselves against the skyrocketing medical costs. In
order to make health insurance products affordable, insurers are also
innovating and focusing on new cost sharing techniques. But at the same
time, with lots of products coming in the market, it is confusing for an
individual to select a health insurance policy which will cater best to
his/her medical requirements. This chapter will discuss the
characteristics of various health insurance products available in the
Indian market.</p>
<h2 id="a-attributes-of-indian-health-insurance-products">A. Attributes of Indian health insurance products</h2>
<ol>
<li>Health insurance products in India</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>General Insurance Corporation of India, which
comprised of four public sector insurance companies, was initially the
largest public sector organisation that offered health insurance
products in India. Later in 2001, the health insurance sector was opened
up for the private sector players, which led to many more companies
entering the health insurance market, and all of them introduced
considerable innovations in their offerings. We will now discuss some of
the health insurance product types now available in India are discussed
in this chapter.. All the products mentioned discussed below are
available in individual (or retail) and also in group variants, where
applicable.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Hospitalisation indemnity products</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Mediclaim was the
first standardised health insurance product that was launched in the
Indian market to provide coverage for hospitalisation expenses up to a
pre-defined annual limit of indemnity. Since then, health insurance in
the Indian context has been dominated by this category - known as
&lsquo;hospitalisation indemnity&rsquo; products. These products protect individuals
from the expenditure they may need to incur in the event of
hospitalisation. In most of the cases, it also covers a specific number
of days before and after hospitalisation, but excludes any expenses not
involving hospitalisation.</p>
<p>Such a cover is provided on an &lsquo;indemnity&rsquo; basis, that is, by making
good part or all of the losses incurred or amount spent during
hospitalisation. This may be compared with the insurance coverage on
benefit basis, where the amount that will be paid on the occurrence of a
certain event (like hospitalisation, diagnosis of critical illness or
each day of admission) is predetermined in the insurance policy and is
not related to the actual expenditure incurred. Thus, it covers the
hospitalisation expenses for an individual up to the sum assured.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Raghu has a small family consisting of his wife and a 14 year
old son. He has taken three Mediclaim policies, one for each member of
his family, from a health insurance company for an individual cover of
Rs. 1 lakh each. All the three policies are independent, and all of them
could get recovery of medical expenses up to Rs. 1 lakh in case of
hospitalisation. Raghu was hospitalised due to heart attack and required
surgery. The medical bill raised was Rs. 1.25 lakhs. The insurance
company paid Rs 1 lakh according to the plan coverage and Raghu had to
pay the remaining amount of Rs. 25,000 from his own pocket. There are
various products offering hospitalisation cover that are available in
the market from different insurers, and differ in their scope of cover.
However, most of these products provide coverage for hospital bed/room,
patient&rsquo;s diet, professional fee of doctors, surgery, operation theatre
charges, medicines, consumables etc.</p>
<h2 id="a-scope-of-cover">a) Scope of cover</h2>
<p>With increasing
competition in the market, insurers are also coming up with variety of
new coverage of items under this category, such as: a) Transplantation
b) Hospitalisation expenses of organ donor c) Cost of artificial limbs
d) Cost of pacemakers e) Cost of haemodialysis f) Coverage of ambulance
charges g) Number of days of pre-and post- hospitalisation expenses h)
Reimbursement for periodic health check-up i) Cost of surgeries done
under day care and j) Maternity</p>
<h2 id="b-exclusions">b) Exclusions</h2>
<p>The hospitalisation cover products from various insurers
differ from each other in exclusions, waiting periods and cost-sharing
provisions. These aspects are covered in more detail in Chapter 5. Some
of the specific exclusions which are not covered by any of the
hospitalisation insurance policies are: a) War/invasion b) Venereal
diseases and HIV/AIDS c) Fertility or assisted conception d) Cosmetic or
aesthetic procedures e) Intentional self-injury f) Influence of
intoxicating drugs or alcohol g) Adventure sports h) Personal comfort i)
Convenience items However, some of these products differ from each other
according to the extent of their coverage such as maternity, dental
treatment, nonallopathic treatment etc.</p>
<h2 id="c-waiting-period">c) Waiting period</h2>
<p>These policies
also provide for a certain waiting period, which mostly is an initial
waiting period of 30 days before any benefits commence. For some of the
specific diseases or procedures, this waiting period is 12 to 48 months,
and such lists may also vary.</p>
<p>Example Mira had taken a health insurance policy for coverage of
expenses in the event of hospitalisation. The policy had a clause for
initial waiting period of 30 days. Unfortunately, 20 days after she took
the policy, Mira contracted malaria and was hospitalised for 5 days. She
had to pay heavy hospital bills. When she asked for reimbursement from
the insurance company, they denied, because the disease (event) occurred
within the waiting period of 30 days from taking the policy.</p>
<h2 id="d-cost-sharing-mechanisms">d) Cost-sharing mechanisms</h2>
<p>Moreover, policies also differ according to
the various cost-sharing mechanisms used by them, like sub-limits on
room and ICU charges, sublimits on payments made for specific surgeries
like cataract or hysterectomy, co-payment for using non-network
hospitals or even for network hospitals etc. These techniques are also
being provided in insurance policies as mechanisms to contain costs for
the insurer and to provide for higher spending being shared by the
insured.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>Somen has taken a mediclaim policy of Rs. 2 lakhs for covering
costs in the event of hospitalisation. The policy had a list of network
hospitals mentioned in it, which states that if the insured visits any
of the in-network hospitals, it will cover 90% of the expenses on
occurrence of the event and 10% will be his copay, i.e. he will have to
pay 10% from his own pocket. However, if he visits a hospital which is
out-of-network, then the insurance company will pay only 80% of the
expenses and the insured will have to pay the remaining 20% from his
pocket. Moreover, there was another clause in the policy stating that in
case of any hospitalisation, the company will cover room charges only up
to 1% of the sum assured for a day. It means that the insurance company
will pay room charges only up to Rs 2000 a day (i.e. 10% of the sum
assured of Rs 2 lakhs) in the event of hospitalisation. These are
examples of cost sharing mechanisms used by insurance companies.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Personal accident</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Personal accident policies are offered both on a
standalone basis and in a packaged product with other health insurance
cover. This policy protects the insured against accidental death and any
form of disablement due to accident. It provides for features like a
lump sum benefit payout in the event of death or permanent disablement,
and a weekly compensation for temporary disablement. Thus, unlike the
hospitalisation indemnity products, this policy usually does not provide
for coverage towards cost of treatment of the insured. However, some of
these policies provide optional medical coverage, which covers certain
outpatient expenses for accidents, in addition to inpatient coverage.
Moreover, newer personal accident policies are also coming in the market
with a whole new range of innovative components - e.g. the cost of
modification of the house or vehicle to meet the medical needs of the
insured after a disabling accident.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>Vijay met his old group of friends one day, and the discussion
came to the various insurance policies and their benefits. One of his
friends, Rahul, asked him if he had taken any personal accident policy.
Vijay asked why he needs such a policy when he already has a life
insurance policy with sufficient cover. Rahul advised him that with the
increasing number of vehicles in the city, the accidents are also
increasing, which has obviously increased this risk. Rahul explained
that a health insurance policy will cover the cost incurred in case of
hospitalisation, and a life insurance policy will cover the risk
associated with death. But if a person dies in an accident, the
dependents of the insured will get a lump sum payment from the personal
accident policy, along with the life insurance assured sum. This policy
is more relevant where the accident results in permanent or temporary
disability to the insured. In such cases, it not only covers the risk
related to the partial or total disablement by providing lump sum
payment, but also provides weekly compensation in some cases. The
premium for such policies is quite low. This convinced Vijay, and he
decided to take a personal accident policy for himself as soon as
possible.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Critical illness</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Dreaded diseases like cancer, heart
attack, coma or major organ failure may be quite infrequent, but are
associated with extremely high costs of healthcare. Moreover, such costs
include a substantial component that may not be covered under the
hospitalisation indemnity products. This could be because of exceeding
of the sum insured due to the very high costs involved, or high
outpatient (ambulatory) expenditure not covered under hospitalisation
insurance etc. There could also be need for additional expenses like
long term nursing care or home-based nursing. Such expenses can be
financially devastating for the household where the critical illness
occurs. Therefore, critical illness products have been introduced to
insure against such diseases and to cover the high expenditure related
to their treatment. Critical illness benefit products provide a lump sum
amount to the insured on the diagnosis of a specific critical illness or
on undergoing of certain procedures. Thus, it does not cover the actual
cost of treatment but pays only the lump sum amount agreed irrespective
of whether that amount had been incurred or not.</p>
<p>Critical illness benefit products, again, are available as standalone
products or as riders to life and non-life policies, or as a component
of a packaged health insurance product. They also provide for high sum
insured limits, ranging up to several million rupees of lump sum
payouts. Some of these policies have a disease specific variant, for
example, the cancer insurance policy provides protection only in the
case of cancer and not for other critical illnesses. These policies are
priced attractively for a high amount of coverage, and are on indemnity
basis and not as a lump sum payout. Some of the critical illness
indemnity products reimburse certain costs due to critical illnesses
rather than providing a lump sum payout, and are therefore priced lower
than other such products.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-1">Test Yourself 1</h2>
<p>Mediclaim policy covers the
____________expenses of an individual up to a predefined
annual limit of indemnity. I. Doctor&rsquo;s consultation II. Medicine III.
Hospitalisation IV. Surgery and operation theatre</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-2">Test Yourself 2</h2>
<p>Which of the following statements about critical illness
products is false? I. They provide insurance against dreaded diseases
such as cancer, heart attack or kidney failure. II. They cover the
actual cost of treatment related to critical illnesses. III. They are
available as standalone products or as a packaged health insurance
product. IV. They provide for high sum insured limits with lump sum
payouts.</p>
<h2 id="b-innovative-health-insurance-products-in-india">B. Innovative health insurance products in India</h2>
<ol>
<li>Daily hospital cash benefit</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>These are new innovative products available in the market in the
form of a fixed daily allowance, which could be used to cover the
unexpected and incidental costs associated with hospitalisation (such as
travel and stay costs of an attendant). It provides the insured with a
daily cash benefit ranging from Rs. 500 to Rs. 2000 for each 24 hours
spent in the hospital, which can be availed as per the specific needs of
the insured. The premium is also decided on the basis of the daily
allowance selected. This payment can be used to share any medical or
non-medical expenses which are normally not covered under
hospitalisation policies but account for a substantial part of the
overall cost incurred during treatment. Hospital cash plans are
available on a standalone basis, and also as an optional component of
some packaged health insurance policies. Thus, at a nominal premium,
this product provides a daily allowance which is in addition to the
indemnity claim and is unlinked to the actual expenditure incurred.
These products are particularly useful for persons covered for health by
employers, where employers&rsquo; health schemes may not bear many of the
incidental costs associated with hospitalisation.</p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example</h2>
<p>Most of the hospital indemnity products have a sub-limit on the
room rent based on the sum insured, such as 1% or 2% of the sum insured.
In this case, if the insured wants to avail a higher category room on
being admitted, he will have to pay from his own pocket. But if he has
taken a daily hospital cash benefit policy along with the
hospitalisation policy, he could utilise the amount of daily allowance
to avail a higher category room and also to meet other incidental
expenses such as travelling, food etc., thus avoiding payment from his
pocket.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>High-deductible hospital indemnity covers</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>A new option that
is available for persons who are either covered by their employers, or
are already holding a hospitalisation policy but with low sum insured &ndash;
is high-deductible cover for individuals (and families). These are topup
covers which provide coverage beyond the deductible amount chosen at the
proposal stage. This threshold ranges from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakhs and
the coverage of this product starts only after the out-of-pocket
expenses or any existing insurance cover has reached this selected
deductible amount.</p>
<p>These products are cost-effective because their premiums are low due to
high deductible amount, making this coverage more affordable. The higher
the deductible, the lower will be the insurance premiums, as the chances
of a person reaching the high level of deductible are very less. This
plan is suitable particularly for those persons who have a low sum
insured in indemnity policies and want to secure themselves against high
medical expenses.</p>
<h2 id="example-4">Example</h2>
<p>Vaibhav has taken a basic health insurance policy with a cover
of Rs.2 lakhs. One of his close relative died due to heart attack and
their family had to pay heavy hospital bills of around Rs. 5 lakhs,
which created a huge financial burden on the deceased&rsquo;s family. This
upset Vaibhav and he started thinking that with the changing environment
and life style; chances of new dreaded diseases are becoming quite high.
Moreover, with the increasing cost of healthcare, his current coverage
will also not be sufficient in case of any emergency. So he wanted to
take another health policy, but the cost of another one was not possible
for him to bear. An insurance agent suggested topping up his current
plan, which will cost less than taking a new insurance policy. So, he
opted for an affordable top-up plan with a sum insured of Rs.5 lakhs and
a threshold limit of Rs.3 lakhs. It means that in case of any emergency,
the policy benefit of Rs. 5 lakhs will kick-in only once he has used his
basic health insurance policy limit of Rs. 2 lakhs and paid Rs.1 lakh
from his pocket (i.e. after reaching the threshold limit of 3 lakhs).</p>

<li>Disease management covers</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>For patients already suffering from chronic
diseases like diabetes, new products are now available in the market,
which are based on the disease management platform. These products
include coverage for some medicines and regular laboratory tests on OPD
basis, in addition to other coverage in the product. This category of
products is still in its early stages in India and may develop further
in the days to come.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Outpatient coverage</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Many of the health insurance
products that are available in the market provide coverage only in case
of hospitalisation for at least 24 hours. But, there are many cases of
primary care or small procedures where hospitalisation is not required
or is required for less than 24 hours. In such cases, the insured has to
pay expenses from his pocket even if he has a health insurance policy.
Therefore, now insurers are making increasing efforts to include this
outpatient coverage in some form as part of the health insurance
products, though these efforts are still in the early stages and will
evolve in the days to come.</p>
<p>As of now, if the policy offers OPD cover, it is likely to come at a
sizeable premium today, as the insurers expect that much or the entire
OPD sum insured will be utilised by the insured. This may change in
future as and when insurers are able to network OPD providers and
negotiate for lower costs with them, and find other ways to reduce the
moral hazard problems in OPD coverage.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Investment products and health savings accounts</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Yet another concept which may take off in some time,
are insurance linked savings plans, also known as Health Savings
Accounts (HSAs)27 or Medical Savings Accounts. In countries like
Singapore and China, these plans are widely used, while these are also
operational in South Africa, US and many other countries. A deferred
indemnity product, which is similar to the purpose of the HSA, has been
marketed by the public sector insurers in India as &lsquo;Bhavishya Arogya&rsquo;
since early 1990s. Bhavishya Arogya is also a hospitalisation product,
but it can be effectively bought in younger ages to build up health
protection for older age. This product also provides an opportunity to
avail tax advantages. Life insurers have also recently launched products
with Health Savings components, and this may increase in popularity in
due course. Under these plans, a portion of the premium collected is
used for risk coverage or for meeting claims and the unutilised portion
of the premium, which is not used, does not lapse, but is accumulated as
savings. These savings could be a solution for the challenges faced by
senior citizens later in obtaining affordable health insurance. In
practice, HSAs are usually combined with a high-deductible or
catastrophic health insurance. HSAs can meet costs of frequent, low-cost
episodes of illnesses (like outpatient consultations, diagnostics and
medicines, or low-cost hospitalisation). On the other hand, the
high-deductible insurance protects HSA beneficiaries from major
illnesses which could cost beyond their savings in HSAs.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Senior citizens&rsquo; products</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Some specific products which meet the needs of senior
citizens have been made available by public as well as private insurance
companies. These products allow entry till a higher age (even up to 80
years in some products) and a continued renewal till ages as high as 80
or 90 years. These products incorporate cost-sharing features like
co-payments and sub-limits to keep a check on the claims as the chances
of medical claims in this age are comparatively very high.</p>
<p>Due to such cost sharing features, premiums are also lower than the
other hospitalisation products available in the market for the same age
group. However, this product is still in its early stages in India as
the insurance companies are not very keen on offering cover to senior
citizens.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Micro-insurance products</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Micro-insurance products are
specifically designed to aim for the protection of low income people
from rural and informal sectors. The low income people form a sizable
part of our population and usually don&rsquo;t have any health security cover.
Therefore, this low value product, with an affordable premium and
benefit package, is initiated to help these people to cope with and
recover from common risks. These products come with a small premium and
typically, the sum insured is below Rs.30,000, as required vide the IRDA
micro-insurance regulations, 2005. Mostly, such covers are taken on a
group basis by various community organizations or non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) for their members. The IRDA&rsquo;s rural and social
sector obligations also require that insurers should sell a defined
proportion of their policies as micro-insurance products, to enable
wider reach of insurance.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>International coverage products</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>A short
term option available for protection against health contingencies
occurring during international travel are the Overseas Medical Insurance
plans. These are mostly packaged as overseas travel plans by including
other components like loss of baggage and cover for flight cancellation
etc. The cost of unexpected medical treatment during an overseas visit
can be very high and could indeed be beyond the means of the overseas
traveller. Overseas medical insurance covers such unforeseen health
related contingencies and protects the insured person from high costs of
medical attention when travelling outside India. Indeed, some countries
insist on having a valid medical insurance as part of the visa
documentation. Although the sum insured is high by Indian standards
(like USD 50,000 in many products), it is in line with the expected high
costs in a foreign land. But as the probability is low and the duration
of cover is short (often in days or weeks), it does not cost a fortune
to buy. Recently, insurers have also designed comprehensive
international products which cover international medical costs as well
as those within the country, and are a form of global health cover and
not just for short term travel. These products are, however, expensive
as they have to cover the possibility of high medical costs in other
countries. Therefore, this kind of products may have a small group of
policyholders, especially that of expatriates or those who travel
extensively.</p>
<h2 id="9-other-innovative-products">9. Other innovative products</h2>
<p>Some products are available in the market
now that provide coverage for persons with HIV, dental treatment etc.
The innovations in this space are increasing and many more innovative
products will continue to be offered by insurers.</p>

benefit allowance is a fixed daily allowance which provides coverage
towards incidental costs associated with hospitalisation, such as travel
and food cost.</p>
