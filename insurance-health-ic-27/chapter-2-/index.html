<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter aims to provide you knowledge about
how the financing of healthcare needs is done in any country. It will
also discuss the health financing models of some of the countries, which
will help to understand the characteristics, advantages and
disadvantages of each method of healthcare financing. Lastly, this
chapter explains the health financing model of our country and its
drawbacks in terms of access and quality.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>A. Sources of funds for healthcare needs B. Health
financing models in various countries C. Health financing system in
India and its problems</p>
<h2 id="look-at-this-scenario">Look at this scenario</h2>
<p>There has been a rapid growth in the economic
development of India in the past few decades. But at the same time,
social development particularly the development of the health sector has
not been paid the required attention for with the same pace. A very less
proportion of resources are allocated for the health sector. According
to some studies commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, the magnitude of health expenditure in India for the year
2008-09 was about 4.13% of the GDP at current market prices.16, 17
However, in actual less than 1% of GDP is spent on the public health
sector in India.</p>
<h2 id="a-sources-of-funds-for-healthcare-needs">A. Sources of funds for healthcare needs</h2>
<p>Globally, the financing of the
healthcare costs in any country is done through the following four
methods: 1. Government revenues and taxes In this system, the population
contributes to the Government revenues indirectly via taxes, a share of
which is then allocated by the Government for providing healthcare care
services to the people. This is therefore also known as tax-funded
system. Thus, the payment to the healthcare providers is made by the
Government on behalf of the users.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>In UK, all residents are enrolled under National Health Services
(NHS) which is primarily funded through the taxes paid to the
Government. It guarantees basic medical services to all residents of the
UK by providing free medical treatment. Hence, it works on principle of
equal treatment and provides equal access to all medical services
regardless of the financial status of an individual.</p>

<h2 id="2-social-health-insurance">2. Social health insurance</h2>
<p>It is also referred to as an employment
based health insurance. The employees and the employers pay a regular
contribution to the funds that are then used for funding healthcare
needs for the employees as well as their families. Additional State
support is also available in some of the cases. Moreover, the
contribution to such schemes can be in varied forms ranging from a
mandatory, earmarked, payroll-tax to a voluntary, tax-deductible
contribution to a health plan.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>ESI Corporation set up in India for blue-collar employees is a
good example of public health insurance. It is financed through a
regular contribution from both the employees and the employers and is
also supplemented by the Government. It provides comprehensive medical
care to industrial sector employees and their families.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Commercial health insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Commercial health insurance is also known as private
health insurance is a health insurance taken by an individual, to
provide coverage towards expenses incurred on their healthcare needs.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>In India, currently more than 300 health insurance products are
available in the market for various healthcare needs. For example, for a
normally healthy person, basic health insurance policy is available from
many insurance companies. Similarly, for senior citizens also some
specific products are available from few insurance companies. Many other
plans are also there in the market to cover critical illnesses.
Nowadays, most of these provide cashless facilities that minimises the
need to maintain any surplus fund by any individual to meet health
casualties.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Out-of-pocket payments</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>It is a direct payment made by the
households to the provider for their healthcare needs without any
coverage or reimbursements. The global picture of health spending for
the year 2007, as per WHO (2010), is summarised below:</p>
<p>Diagram 1: Composition of world health expenditures</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-health//Health_Finanacing_Models_Financing_in_India21.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Source: National Health Accounts, WHO (2010) Thus, health is a large
industry globally, and commands US 5.3 trillion dollars (about Rs 240
lakh crores) of the world&rsquo;s resources, and the proportion of each sector
is as follows: Table 2.1 Source of Funds Government tax revenues Social
insurance Private insurance Direct payment by patients Other smaller
sources</p>
<p>Composition (%) 35 25 18 18 4</p>
<p>The percentage mentioned above clearly indicates that the share of
Government tax revenues is highest among all these spending in the
world. However, this 35% share does not include: 9 Any contribution made
by the Government to the social health insurance, and 9 The indirect tax
subsidies, often given by the Government to the private health
insurance. Similarly, households had to directly pay from their pocket
18% of the health costs globally, but this percentage excludes: 9 Their
contribution as taxes which is spent by the government on the
healthcare, or 9 Their payments for insurance premiums that are pooled
and spent on insurance mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-1">Test Yourself 1</h2>
<p>Which of the following sector has the highest
contribution in financing of the healthcare costs globally? I. Social
health insurance II. Government revenues and taxes III. Private health
insurance IV. Commercial health insurance</p>
<h2 id="b-health-financing-models-in-various-countries">B. Health financing models in various countries</h2>
<p>In this Learning
Outcome, we will discuss about the health insurance schemes in some of
the countries around the world18.</p>
<ol>
<li>Germany</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Germany has one of the best
healthcare systems in the world. In Germany, over 90 percent of the
residents receive healthcare through the statutory health insurance. It
functions through non-profit sickness funds that collect premiums from
members and pay health care providers according to pre-negotiated
agreements. Employers and employees contribute equally in the premiums,
which in the first half of the 1990s averaged between 12 and 13 percent
of a worker's gross earnings up to the income ceiling19. Hence, in
simple terms, health insurance premium is collected from employees as a
payroll tax. As this is a social health insurance scheme, premiums are
set according to the earnings rather than the risk. The premiums are not
affected by a member's marital status, family size or health. The
unemployed continue to be members of their sickness fund, and their
contributions are paid by federal and local Government offices. The
contributions of retired workers are paid by themselves from their
pension funds.</p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example</h2>
<p>The health financing model of Germany is a perfect example of a
public health insurance financing model which redistributes from higher
to lower income groups, from the healthy to the sick, from the young to
the old, from the employed to the unemployed, and from those without
children to those with children. Employees who have private insurance
also receive the benefit of part of their premiums being paid by their
employers.</p>

<h2 id="2-france">2. France</h2>
<p>France has a system of employment-based public health
insurance that now covers everybody in the nation, though earlier,
certain portions of the population lacked any health insurance. There
are three healthcare funds operating in the country that are: a) Main
one covering most of the workers b) One for the self-employed and c) One
for the agricultural workers The financing of the system is through
employer and employee contributions in addition to general taxes, of
which the latter have been increasing in proportion in recent years. The
funds are under the joint control of employers and employee unions,
which are in turn supervised by the state. The contribution to these
funds is mandatory, and no one may opt-out of the scheme. Moreover, they
are not allowed to compete with each other nor micromanage care. This
insurance system covers a large share of all the health costs in the
country, the rest being met through out-of-pocket payments and the
supplementary insurance covers. However, many of the French citizens
also opt for some form of add-on private insurance, which pays for the
various procedures and equipment that are not covered wholly by the
public insurance20.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>United States of America</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Since World War II,
employment-based health benefits have been the foundation of health
insurance in the United States for the under-65 population, providing
the primary source of coverage for the vast majority of workers and
their dependents. In 2004, 159.1 million individuals, or 62 percent of
the nonelderly adult population were covered by the employment-based
health benefits system. However, in recent years, the numbers of persons
covered under employersponsored health insurance have been reducing
sharply, mainly due to rising cost of providing healthcare benefits as
compared to individual earnings. This has resulted in a larger
proportion of the US population without any health insurance coverage
and forecasts of continuing declines in coverage. The overall impact on
the economy is also not good due to increase in poorer health and death
of uninsured individuals. The Government provides insurance for the
elderly (Medicare) and for the poor (Medicaid) which has been an
increasing expenditure for the public exchequer. Overall, health costs
account for an overwhelming 16% of the country&rsquo;s GDP and there are
growing concerns over the sustainability of this expenditure.</p>
<h2 id="4-japan">4. Japan</h2>
<p>Japan achieved universal health coverage in 1961, through the
National Health Insurance Act. The healthcare system in Japan has been
considered as one of the best in the world in terms of its accessibility
and efficiency. This system provides coverage to the entire population
with a universal access to all medical services. The coverage is
provided to each individual under any one of the following categories:</p>
<h2 id="a-society-managed-health-insurance-shi">a) Society-managed health insurance (SHI)</h2>
<p>This program covers employees
of large company (with more than 700 employees) and their dependants.
These employers are required to create and operate their own health
insurance plans within the Government regulations. It covers 26% of the
Japan&rsquo;s population.</p>
<h2 id="b-government-managed-health-insurance-ghi">b) Government managed health insurance (GHI)</h2>
<p>In this
scheme, the employees who are working with small employers (with less
than 700 employees) and their dependants are automatically enrolled
under a Government operated program known as &lsquo;small business national
health plan&rsquo;. This plan covers about 30% of Japan&rsquo;s population and is
financed by both, the payroll taxes and the general fund revenue.</p>
<h2 id="c-national-health-insurance-nhi">c) National Health Insurance (NHI)</h2>
<p>It covers self-employed, retired,
unemployed and other people who are not covered in above two plans. This
plan is administered by the Municipal Governments and is financed
through compulsory premium on the self-employed and general tax
revenues.</p>
<h2 id="d-long-life-medical-care-system">d) Long life medical care system</h2>
<p>This plan was introduced in
1983 for the elderly person aged 75 and over. It also covers people aged
65 to 74 with certain certified disabilities. It is financed through a
fixed nominal amount paid by the insured (10%), contributions from the
other plans (40%) and general tax revenues (50%). All these plans are
required to cover a range of benefits, which include dental care,
maternity care, and prescription drugs. In 2008, over 80% of the health
costs in Japan were borne by the Government and less than 20% came from
private sources (just the opposite of the situation in India).</p>
<h2 id="example-4">Example</h2>
<p>Enrolment in the health insurance system is compulsory in Japan
and applies to all residents including foreigners (short-period visitors
are excluded). Thus, a person who is not a resident of Japan but have
the permission to stay in Japan for at least a year due to his studies
or work is also required to join any one of the insurance programs even
if he is covered overseas under a private insurance. Japan&rsquo;s health
financing system is designed in such a way that it ensures that every
resident is covered under any one of the insurance programs available in
the country.</p>

<li>Chile</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The functioning of the healthcare system in
Chile21 has undergone major reforms in the early 1980s. The main
features of this system are as follows: a) The establishment of the
National Health Fund (Fonasa) to administer the social health insurance
scheme. b) The establishment of Health Insurance Institutions, Isapres
for the private sector players. c) The mandatory contribution by each
employee and pensioner, equivalent to 7% of their wages towards
healthcare system. The population in Chile can opt to contribute into
either of the two healthcare system, i.e. Fonasa (public health
insurance system) or Isapres (private health insurance system). About
67% of the population in Chile is enrolled with Fonasa, while 20% are
covered under some 40,000 private plans with 18 licensed Isapres. Thus,
the healthcare system in Chile is working on dual structure, both public
and private sector working for healthcare services but on different
principles. Both schemes are regulated by the Superintendence of
Isapres, under the Ministry of Health (Government of Chile). Fonasa is
funded to the tune of 50 per cent by general tax revenues of the
government, while the remaining financing occurs through the mandatory
contribution by employees and retired people. Substantial out-of-pocket
payments are, however, common, despite the high wage contribution by the
employees.</p>
<h2 id="6-thailand">6. Thailand</h2>
<p>In Thailand22, there are three main insurance schemes that
cover most of the country&rsquo;s population and are as follows: a) The Civil
Servant Medical Benefits Schemes (CSMBS) It covers Government employees,
has the most liberal payouts and covers about 8% of the country&rsquo;s
population. b) The Social Security Scheme (SSS) It resembles the ESIS in
India in many ways. It is a mandatory, tripartite contribution scheme,
where costs are shared by the employers, employees and the Government at
the rate of 1% of wages each. Thus, it offers social security to formal
sector employees (establishments with greater than 10 employees) and
covers about 15% of the population. c) Universal Coverage Scheme The
third scheme is for the informal sector, which covers all citizens not
covered under the CSMBS or the SSS. The Thai health system uses a unique
combination of provider payment mechanisms, including capitation, DRGs
and Global Budgets.</p>

<li>Financing of Health in India</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Financing of a
health system is closely and indivisibly linked to the provisioning of
services and helps define the outer boundaries of the system&rsquo;s
capability to achieve its stated goals23. Based on two separate studies
commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of
India (National Health Accounts Cell, 2009 and the earlier study by the
National Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, 2005), the magnitude
of health expenditure in India for the year 2008-09 was estimated as
about 4.13% of the GDP at current market prices24,25.</p>

<ol>
<li>Health financing system in India</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The sources of
health financing in India are almost same as indicated in the global
picture above. The tax-based public health system has already been
discussed in the previous chapter. We have also discussed about the
various forms of employment-based health coverage that already exist in
India, which include: a) b) c) d)</p>
<p>The widely recognized Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIS) for
employees in the formal sector, The Central Government Health Scheme
(CGHS) for serving and retired civil servants, The schemes for serving
and retired employees of the Armed Forces, Railways, Paramilitary forces
and other Government organizations, and The various health coverage
schemes and benefits provided by banks, insurers, other public sector
companies and the private sector employers26.</p>
<h2 id="2-public-expenditure-on-health-in-india">2. Public expenditure on health in India</h2>
<p>Out of the total health
expenditure in the country, the share of public or Government spending,
i.e. that of Central, State and Local Governments taken together, is
about one-fifth of the total health expenditure (NHA Cell, 2009). As a
result of this, Indian population is mostly dependent upon the
privatised healthcare system. In India, the private healthcare
expenditure amounts to around 72% and the public expenditure is around
26% of the total healthcare expenditure.</p>
<h2 id="example-5">Example</h2>
<p>The per capita total health spending in India was about US $23
during 19972000 (World Bank 2003). At about 1% of the GDP, India&rsquo;s
public health spending appears poorly funded in comparison with
countries like China, Sri Lanka and Thailand, for which this proportion
was 1.95%, 1.8% and 3.06% respectively.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>National rural health mission</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>One of the most significant developments in the public health financing
system of the country in recent years has been the introduction of the
National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). This scheme aims to reduce the gap
between the healthcare available in urban areas and rural areas. NRHM
bought additional money for the health sector with the help of several
health financing innovations like 'untied funds'. These untied funds
enabled the availability and access of quality healthcare system to all
people, especially who are residing in rural areas. These funds provide
resources to health facilities and community level bodies without
earmarking to line items. They can spend these funds, within the
guidelines of the program on virtually any area where the facility
requires. NRHM also attempted integration of the vertical disease
control programs under a single umbrella.</p>
<h2 id="example-6">Example</h2>
<p>NRHM has strengthened the infrastructure of public health
facilities in rural areas in terms of equipment, structure and human
resources. The other key focus area of the mission was delegating the
powers to the facilities to hire specialist doctors on contract basis.
NRHM also introduced a grassroots level link worker in villages, the
ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) worker, who is a volunteer from
the community, trained by the public health system and act as a link of
the community with the public health system.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Problems of access and service quality</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The guide-lines for national health planning in India
were provided by a number of committees dating back to the Bhore
committee in 1946. It laid the foundations of a comprehensive primary
health care delivery system in the country, not too different from the
National Health Service in UK and other such tax-funded health provision
models in many countries. Over the last six decades, India did attempt
to build up an extensive public health infra-structure at primary,
secondary and tertiary levels, with mixed success.</p>
<p>The public health sector continues to face problems like poorly
motivated manpower, inadequacy of funding, skewed geographical
distribution and other access issues. The problem of access to
healthcare is even more pronounced in rural and remote areas, where
qualified providers from the private sector are also conspicuous by
their absence. In the urban areas, though private providers are
available in plenty, but there also they continue to be poorly regulated
for pricing and quality, despite a multitude of legislations having been
enacted for the health sector. The absence of any significant influence
from large organized purchasers of healthcare (like insurance mechanisms
or the government itself) has also contributed to the situation where
there is virtually no check on what a provider can charge for healthcare
services, and often no check even on the quality of services rendered.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Need for financial protection and advantages of health insurance mechanisms</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>While is a substantial awareness of health insurance being a
mechanism for financial protection of the members to meet costs of their
healthcare, but it is important to remember that health insurance also
has the potential to influence healthcare provider behaviour. We have
earlier discussed about supply side and demand side moral hazards.
Health insurance itself contributes to this risk by providing increased
access to healthcare system to many people, who would otherwise be not
able to afford such healthcare by overcoming the cost barrier. Moreover,
health insurance schemes can have a negotiating power by acting as a
large purchaser of healthcare facilities, something which an individual
without insurance otherwise cannot achieve. However, poorly designed
health insurance system can influence the healthcare providers pushing
up the costs. . This will result in reduced access to the healthcare for
the uninsured people and thus, has implications on the accessibility,
costs and quality of healthcare.</p>

<p>How much is the share of government spending on the
total health expenditure in our country? I. One-third II. One-fourth
III. One-fifth IV. One-sixth</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>a) Globally, the financing of healthcare costs is done through
four methods: government revenues, social health insurance, commercial
health insurance and out-of-pocket expenses. b) The healthcare financing
in Germany is based on social health insurance system and is mainly
funded through premiums collected from employees as a payroll tax. c)
Healthcare is provided in France through three healthcare funds: one for
most of the workers, one for the self-employed and one for the
agricultural workers. d) The healthcare system of USA was mainly based
on employment based health benefits but due to rising cost of healthcare
benefits as compared to individual earnings, the number of persons
covered under insurance has reduced sharply resulting in a poor impact
on their economy. e) Japan has one of the best healthcare systems in the
world in terms of accessibility and efficiency. It provides coverage to
the entire population with a universal access to all medical services.
f) The health financing model of India is very poor and is mainly
dependent upon private services. g) The public health spending in India
is less than 1% of the GDP that is very low as compared to the other
countries. h) National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) has been introduced
in our country to reduce the gap between healthcare services provided in
rural and urban areas. i) There are lot of problems faced by the public
healthcare system in India in rural areas such as lack of healthcare
facilities, transportation, long distances, cost of services and
discriminatory treatment to users. j) An effective government regulatory
mechanism and adequate public funding is required to operate health
insurance mechanisms in any country otherwise, it can pose a threat to
equity and efficiency of health systems rather than a healthcare
facility.</p>
