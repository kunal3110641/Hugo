      <description>Introduction to Amazon Web Services Amazon Web Services (AWS), a subsidiary of Amazon.com, has invested billions of dollars in IT resources distributed across the globe. These resources are shared among all the AWS account holders across the globe. These account themselves are entirely isolated from each other. AWS provides on-demand IT resources to its account holders on a pay-as-you-go pricing model with no upfront cost. Amazon Web services offers flexibility because you can only pay for services you use or you need.</description>

      <description>Identity and Access Management In a recent study by Verizon, 63% of the confirmed data breaches are due to either weak, stolen, or default passwords used. There is a saying in the cybersecurity world that goes like this &amp;ldquo;No matter how good your chain is it&amp;rsquo;s only as strong as your weakest link.&amp;rdquo; and exactly hackers use the weakest links in the organization to infiltrate. They usually use phishing attacks to infiltrate an organization and if they get at least one person to fall for it, it&amp;rsquo;s a serious turn of events from thereon.</description>

      <description>Elastic Load Balancer in AWS In simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing the data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on the internet instead of the computer&amp;rsquo;s hard drive or local server. It is also referred to as Internet-based computing.
Features of cloudÂ No up-front investment
Lowering operating cost
Highly scalable and efficient
Easy access
Reducing business risks and maintenance expenses
Advantages of Elastic Load Balancer ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, to achieve high availability.</description>
