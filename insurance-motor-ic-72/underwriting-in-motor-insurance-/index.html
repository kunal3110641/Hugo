<h2 id="a-market-practice-of-motor-insurance-in-india">A. Market practice of Motor Insurance in India</h2>
<p>Motor Vehicle insurance
in India was governed by India Motor Tariffs effective from 01-08-1989
till December 2006. The Authority vide circular no. 021/IRDA/F7U/Sep 06
dated 28-09-2006 stated that w.e.f. 01-01-2007 all the tariffs stand
withdrawn subject to the condition that insurers shall not vary the
coverage, terms and conditions, wordings, warranties, clauses and
endorsements in respect of covers that were under tariffs. Further
rationalisation has been done vide IRDA/NL/ORD/MPL/077/03/2012 dated
29th March, 2012. Insurers were given freedom to quote individual rates
for the Motor insurance products excluding Third Party Liability. The
Third Party Liability premium is still being regulated by the IRDAI. All
other terms conditions and rules of the erstwhile India Motor Tariff are
still in use. However, the rates they proposed to quote for Own Damage
section were required to be filed with the regulator before circulation.
The third party liability premium is being regulated by the IRDAI for
the reason that being a loss making portfolio on the one hand and being
statutory insurance as per law on the other, freeing the pricing would
have lead to spiraling of Third Party Premium to the detriment of
policyholder. 1. Caveats for filing add-on covers The IRDAI subsequently
permitted insurers to file add-on covers to the main product from 1st
April 2009 with the following caveats: a) Insurers are permitted to file
variations in deductibles from those prescribed under the erstwhile
Fire, Engineering, IAR and Motor OD Tariffs subject to written
disclosures and acceptance by the insured prior to finalisation of the
insurance policy. b) Insurers are permitted to file add-on covers over
and above the erstwhile tariff covers in Fire, Engineering, IAR and
Motor OD with appropriate additional premiums. ‗Loss of Use&rsquo; and ‗Waiver
of Depreciation&rsquo; under motor OD insurance is some example. c) Revised
products, subject to approvals under File &amp; Use guidelines may be
offered to the current policy holders on renewal. In other words,
insurers are not permitted to cancel/withdraw existing insurance
products to replace them by the revised products. However, insured shall
have the option to cancel their existing policies on short period scales
and go in for the revised products. d) In the development process of
motor insurance products and prices, the Insurance Regulator has laid
down File &amp; Use guidelines as given hereunder:
i. Design of products should be on sound and prudent norms in a
transparent manner and provide value to the customer. ii. Simple
language should be used in all literature of the product. The terms
should be clearly defined and in a simple easy language. iii. The
product should be a genuine insurable risk product with a real risk
transfer element. iv. It should comply with the rights of IRDA
(Protection of Policy Holders Interest) Regulation -2002. v. Similar
wordings for similar products or requirements across various products to
be maintained e.g., renewal terms, cancellation, and arbitration clauses
must be alike across all products. vi. Pricing should be based on
appropriate data and sound technical justifications. vii. Terms and
conditions should be fair. viii. Margins built into rates should be
consistent with insurers&rsquo; experience. ix. Unprincipled rate cutting and
inappropriate underwriting to combat competition should be avoided.
Although the insurers have been freed from the tyranny of tariff norms
for Motor OD rating, they continue to follow the erstwhile Tariff
guidelines including wordings.</p>

<h2 id="ix-geographical-zones-gr-10">ix. Geographical zones (GR 10)</h2>
<p>India has been divided into the
following zones for the purpose of rating, depending on the location of
the office of registration or maximum use of the vehicle. Private cars /
Motorized two wheelers / Commercial vehicles rated as Taxis (not
exceeding 6 passengers) Zone A: Zone B:</p>
<p>Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, New Delhi and Pune Rest of India</p>
<p>Hyderabad,</p>
<p>Kolkata,</p>
<p>Commercial Vehicles other than vehicles covered above Zone A: Zone B:
Zone C:</p>
<p>Chennai, Delhi/New Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai All other State Capitals
Rest of India</p>
<p>These broad outlines of zoning are followed by insurers. Some insurers
have formed further sub-zones based on their claim experience. e.g.,
Commercial vehicles and Two-wheelers in major cities are classed for the
higher zones than above or sub-classed with higher- rate than the class
they fall under. Italy is a small country having 640 sub zones just to
draw your kind attention to appreciate the concept of Zoning.</p>
<p>Author note The author feels that in India ‗Geographical Zones&rsquo; needs
serious consideration for rating purpose review, depending on the ‗Risk

<h2 id="x-insureds-declared-value-idv-gr-8">x. Insured‟s declared value IDV (GR 8)</h2>
<p>IDV is the amount for which the vehicle is insured. It is deemed to be the Sum
Insured for the policy period. This is defined in the policy as detailed
below and is therefore, part of the policy terms. IDV is fixed on the
basis of the manufacturer‟s listed selling price of the brand and model,
as the vehicle is proposed for insurance at the commencement of
insurance/renewal and is adjusted for depreciation (as per schedule
below). The IDV for sidecar(s) and/or accessories fitted to the vehicle

<h2 id="xix-no-claim-bonus-gr-27">xix. No claim bonus (GR 27)</h2>
<p>No Claim Bonus (NCB) is earned only on the
Own damage section of the Package policy covering all classes of vehicle
except Motor Trade Policies, Road Transit Risks; Road Risks: Internal
Risks. For policies covering Liability including Fire &amp;/or Theft risks
the NCB will be applicable on the Fire and/or Theft premium only. An
insured becomes entitled to NCB only at the renewal of the policy after
the expiry of the full duration of twelve months. No Claim Bonus is a
discount on premium of the Own Damage (OD) portion of vehicle when a
policy is renewed, provided insured has not made any claim during the
last policy period of one year. The NCB can be accumulated up to a
maximum limit of 50% on OD premium. All types of vehicles No claim made
or pending during the preceding full year of insurance No claim made or
pending during the preceding 2 consecutive years of insurance No claim
made or pending during the preceding 3 consecutive years of insurance No
claim made or pending during the preceding 4 consecutive years of
insurance No claim made or pending during the preceding 5 consecutive
years of insurance</p>
<p>% of discount on od premium 20% 25% 35% 45% 50%</p>
<p>Insured can transfer full benefits of NCB, even when he shifts his motor
insurance to any other Insurance company. No Claim bonus is incorporated
in the policy as per the following table: Discount on premium is uniform
for all types of vehicles, ranges from minimum 20% to maximum 50%,
corresponding with 1 to 5 consecutive claim free years as per Table.
Sunset Clause: Sun set clause is amended to read ―insured entitled to
such % of NCB per pre revised tariff and the same shall stand protected
at the renewal falling due any day after 01.07.2002. After 01.07.2003
the NCB will be as per the new tariff till a claim arises. (c) NCB is to
be computed on OD premium after deducting rebate for Vehicle Laid Up.
Failure to write to previous insurer within 21 days &amp; failure to reply
by previous insurer within 30 days amounts to breach of Tariff.</p>
<p>(a) No Claim Bonus (NCB) Transferability: The percentage of applicable
NCB is computed on the Own damage premium. The NCB follows the fortune
of the original insured and not the vehicle or the policy. In case the
customer is switching/changing to a company from any other insurance
company, and have accrued some NCB from previous insurer, insured can
get the same transferred in case the vehicle is insured within 90 days
of renewal due date. The same applies in case insured is shifting from
current insurer to other insurance company. In the event of transfer,
the new owner is not entitled to the NCB and hence the proportionate
amount will be recovered; if the new owner is not presently entitled to
NCB or not enjoying NCB. (b) Evidence for NCB: The NCB will be
transferred at the same rate that insured is entitled to get from the
previous insurance company on renewal of your policy. The NCB will be
available; provided he can produce evidence that he was entitled to No
Claim Bonus from his previous insurance company. Evidence can be in form
of:  A renewal notice or  A letter confirming the NCB entitlement from
the previous insurer or  A written declaration (kindly note that in
case of a false declaration, the policy will be subject to cancellation)
(c) NCB on Substituted Vehicle or on Death of the Insured: NCB can be
allowed on a substituted vehicle. However, the substituted vehicle must
be of the same class as the vehicle on which the NCB has been earned. In
the case of an individual owner, in the event of death of the
individual, where the custody of the vehicle passes to the spouse and/or
children and/or parents or others, the NCB entitlement can be
transferred to the legal heir. (d) NCB earned by an institution: The
percentage of NCB earned on a vehicle owned by an institution during the
period when it was allotted to and exclusively operated by an employee
can be passed on to the employee, if the ownership of the vehicle is
transferred in the name of the employee. This will however require
submission of a suitable letter from the employer confirming that prior
to transfer of ownership of the vehicle to the employee, it was allotted
to and exclusively operated by the employee during the period in which
the NCB was earned. (e) Allowing lesser NCB: In practice a few insurers
are allowing lesser NCB than entitled on transfer. e.g., 3 year old
Private Car - Santro with 45% NCB entitlement is allowed only 25% NCB by
the transferee insurer.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>There is also a practice to allow lesser NCB on Substitute Vehicle
belonging to different sub-classe.</p>
<p>Example A Maruti 800 Pvt. Car is substituted by a Mercedes Benz, though
the NCB entitlement is 50% on substitution, the transferee insurer is
allowing only 35%. (f) NCB on Vehicle Sold but not Replaced: If a
vehicle is sold but not replaced immediately the NCB earned could be
claimed within three years of cancellation of policy sold, for any fresh
insurance. In practice insurer is now allowing lesser NCB than entitled,
keeping in mind subclasses involved? In the two-wheeler and commercial
category the discount and entitlement period for such cases have also
been curtailed in practice.</p>

Motor Vehicles Act 1988 which requires that Third Party Liability
insurance coverage should be subsisting to protect the rights of third
parties. The transferor must apply within 14 days from the date of
transfer in writing under recorded delivery to the insurer, who has
insured the vehicle with the details of the registration of the vehicle,
the date of transfer of the vehicle, the previous owner of the vehicle
and the number and date of the insurance policy, so that the insurer may
incorporate necessary changes in their record and issue a fresh
Certificate of Insurance under the provisions of MV Act 1988. The
certificate issued to previous insured is to be surrendered. In the case
of Package policies, transfer of ―own damage‖ section of the policy in
favour of the transferee is made only on receipt of specific request
from the transferee with explicit consent of transferor. If the
transferee is not entitled to NCB shown on the policy, or is entitled to
lesser percentage of NCB, the insurer shall recover the proportionate
amount at the time of transfer. A fresh proposal form is to be obtained
for all transfers. An administrative fee is charged to issue fresh
Certificate of insurance. In case of transfer of Package policies,
evidence of sale and surrender of previous certificate of insurance is
essential. If for any reason the old certificate of insurance cannot be

<p>The Premium computation chart in all policies is as above with minor
variations. The premium rates were charged in the erstwhile tariff on
the basis of various factors as follows: i. Private Car: The Own damage
premium was based on the:  Zone of registration of the vehicle (a) Zone
1 Major cities; (b) Zone 2 Rest of India Cubic capacity (a) below
100cc (b) 100 to 1500cc (c) Over 1500cc.  Age of the vehicle (a) Below
5 years (b) 5 to 10 years&rsquo; (c) Over 10 years. From the Table given
above, the rate is ascertained and applied to the IDV. This becomes the
Basic OD Premium. To this the add-on premium for additional items is
included and shown separately. For example Bi-fuel kit @4% on the value
is added, so also for electronic fittings a similar rate is added.
Thereafter, the discounts are allowed on reducing balance i.e., the
Total Premium as above is discounted for each discount head
individually. The last discount is always the NCB.</p>
<p>The TP premium is based on Zone and cubic capacity. In the case of
private car no additional premium is charged for Passenger Liability,
hence nothing under this head would be charged. All add-ons like
Liability for driver, PA to owner-driver, PA to passengers would be
charged. The total premium would comprise the TP premium. The Total of

2) Other state capitals 3) Rest of India. Instead of cc the GVW- for
goods carrying vehicles; and passenger capacity for passenger vehicles
would apply. g) Taxis up to 6 passengers the Private Car system would be
followed. However, for TP cover extra for passenger liability is to be
charged. This would be on registered passenger carrying capacity. h) For
other passenger carrying vehicles, the OD premium criterion is based on:
i. Zone for plying vehicle ii. Passenger carrying capacity and iii. Age
of vehicle. For liability Section additional for liability to passengers
is also charged compulsorily. Liability for driver and conductor is also
to be charged. Other premium is as per the private car system. i) Goods
carrying vehicles (GVW) It is replaced by carrying capacity. In the case
of liability Section besides driver&rsquo;s liability, persons employed for
loading and unloading are also required to be covered. The number is as
permitted by the RTA (Regional Transport Authority). In the normal
course permitted total employees including driver is six persons. In
exceptional cases more may be permitted; to be verified from RC book.
Cover for Owner of goods as non-fare paying passenger is also to be
charged. Other covers are as per the Private car system.</p>

<li>Tariff system after detariffing Subsequent to de-tariffing most insurers continue to
follow the tariff system and rates as base premium. They are then
working out discounts and loading on the basis of their perceptions of
risk. These may be in the form of a matrix for different risk exposures,
similar to the system introduced in the tariff for Third Party loading.
Based on the points so obtained the premium may be loaded or discounted.
(Refer Annexure F at the end of this Chapter) The motor tariff was
withdrawn with effect from 1st Jan 2007. Insurers are permitted to
devise their own premium structure for Own damage coverage. The third
party liability premiums continue to be under tariff and the rates are
as advised by IRDAI. Policy wordings as per the erstwhile tariff are to
be continued, however, additional covers as add-ons to the main policy
including any deviations from the erstwhile tariff rates for the
standard products are permitted to be devised by the insurers and filed
with IRDAI under File &amp; Use guidelines before introduction into the
market. a) Understanding riders available in the market Based on this
leeway to insurers the following extra Cover or Add-ons are now being
offered by insurers. These benefits are only available for owners of
Private cars. In most of these add-on covers, the onus of proving the
damage caused by exclusion does not apply on the insured, unlike the
practice for the standard cover wherein proving exclusion is on insurer.
i. Depreciation reimbursement: The depreciation under the standard
policies for replacement of parts damaged in an accident covered under
the policy is being waived under this add-on. The cover is, however,
conditional to the age of vehicle being below 3 years and not more than
two OD claim having been lodged during the policy period. The repair of
the vehicle to be done at the insurers approved repairer. The
deductibles under the policy will be applicable. (a) The variations
among insurers may be on partial reimbursement, if repairs at insured&rsquo;s
regular repairer. (b) A restriction on the maximum claims for this
benefit in a policy year. (c) Tyres and batteries would be excluded.</li>

<h2 id="d-international-practice-in-motor-insurance-rating">D. International practice in motor insurance rating</h2>
<h2 id="a-globalised-motor">a) Globalised motor</h2>
<p>insurance in India Motor insurance in India has substantially followed
the practice of the UK insurance market. In fact the policy terms and
conditions are very similar. Subsequent to de-tariffing the new covers
being offered by insurers are broadly similar to what is available
across the world. It can thus be said that Motor insurance in India is
now globalised.</p>
<h2 id="b-international-motor-insurance-business">b) International motor insurance business</h2>
<p>Internationally Motor is non tariff business except in some of the less
developed countries of Asia and Africa. There are wide variations in the
premium rates for the basic coverage and add-ons. Some of the variations
relate to colour of the vehicle, persons driving the vehicle. i. Role of
Motor Insurance in road traffic regulations and motor vehicle
manufacturing: Motor insurers also play a major role in road traffic
regulations and motor vehicle manufacturing. In USA most motor vehicle
manufactures seek the star rating of insurers for the vehicles, as it
results in lower premium rates for their customers. Traffic offences,
non-adherence to regulations on road safety are immediately penalized
resulting even in loss of insurance cover and driving licences. Several
insurers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have begun charging motor
insurance premiums based on the drivers' traffic record, as they now
have an electronic link to the traffic departments in the federation via
a portal called Markabty launched by the Ministry of Interior. ii. Use
of variables in US markets: The rating pattern for private cars in the
U.S.A. involves the use of variables. The following notes are an outline
of the rating pattern, with insurers making their own variations
relating to Driver&rsquo;s age, gender and marital status.</p>
<p>(a) Young drivers: Generally persons under 25 years are considered as
young drivers. Although some insurers have made separate classes for
each age band e.g., 17 to 20 and 21 to 24. Most insurers have a separate
class for drivers over 65. (b) Sex of driver: Female drivers are
considered better risk than male, thus entitling them to discounts on
the standard premium. Female drivers below a certain age are safer
drivers and attract lower rates. (c) Marital status of the driver:
Married driver may attract lower rates than unmarried drivers. (d) Use
of Vehicle: Car may be for personal or pleasure purpose or for business
purpose, driver to and fro over or under a given number of miles. Annual
driving mileage may also be taken into account. Use categories may vary
between adult and young operators. (e) Geographical Area of Use: The
place where the vehicle is driven, is a factor of rating as accidents
are influenced, low lying areas and climate, urban areas usually have
higher rates. Territories exposure remains the same for all age -
gender, marital class and all use classes. (f) Driving record of the
driver: Number of years of driving experience is also used as a
criteria. Past accidents and tariff violations are also used as
important criterion. Some insurers give good student and driver training
discounts. (g) Nature of the Vehicle: Age of the vehicle, value of the
vehicle, make and model of the vehicle are major factors to assess
susceptibility to decedents, demography, protection provided to
occupants of the vehicle in the event of accidents.</p>
<h2 id="e-underwriting-in-motor-insurance-motor-insurance">E. Underwriting in motor insurance Motor Insurance</h2>
<p>business is generally considered to be unprofitable class of business due to heavy third party
out go. In recent years the claims experience has shown signs of
deterioration due to cut throat competition in premium in own damage
section as well, though not alarming.</p>
<ol>
<li>Underwriting in Motor Insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>With the increase in the number of vehicles and traffic density, higher
costs of labour and spare parts and escalating awards for third party
claims, control of claims cost is imperative. It is, therefore, most
essential to adopt a sound underwriting policy which involves not only
careful selection of risks and imposition of appropriate terms and
conditions but also close monitoring of risks at renewal, in the light
of claim experience.</p>
<h2 id="a-underwriters-critical-analysis">a) Underwriters‟ critical analysis</h2>
<p>The first step in underwriting is a
close scrutiny of the proposal form which must be completed by the owner
of the vehicle. The proposal form reveals information which is used for
underwriting the risk, i.e. deciding whether to accept the risk and if
so the extent of cover to be offered and rating subject to the terms and
conditions. It is aptly said that a concern that does not produce profit
has no right to exist. Prudent underwriting consists of two important
assets, one is to acquire knowledge which is not difficult and the other
is to relate it to experience in the field and then to utilize it for
successful underwriting so as to ultimately earn profit. It relates to
perusal of proposal form &amp; supporting documents and people/insured,</p>
<p>Their status; Subject matter of Insurance; Surroundings; Nature of
Business, Factors influencing motor insurance; Premium potential;
Vehicle population; Density of population; Conditions of roads; Use in
terrain/infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="b-long-term-underwriting-strategy">b) Long term underwriting strategy</h2>
<p>Long term strategy is to build up a
credible database in order to determine rating factors and its effects
based on actual Indian market experience. For renewals of existing
business and for new business the insurance proposal form should be
extended to include information regarding all of the desirable rating
factors. Ideally data should be available on all possible rating factors
at the time of taking policy viz. age, sex of driver, geography, type of
vehicle, source of business, ownership status, and presence of security
devices. Once one or two year's complete data is available, detailed
modeling of claims data can be undertaken by Generalized Linear Models.
These techniques allow for proper measurement of the important rating
factors. Opportunities do exist for astute insurers to enhance their
profitability in open markets by differentiating the risks within their
portfolios. Now is the time to commence this analysis. Insurers that are
willing to accept whatever business comes their way will continue to
suffer anti-selection and experience increasing difficulty in making
profits.</p>
<p>The factors influencing motor risk management are potential hazards of
vehicles; its uses, drivers ability, premium potential of the class,
vehicle density, geographical impact, infrastructure condition viz.
conditions of roads, availability of garages, safety regulations in
place; uninsured population etc. c) Risk profiling i. Vehicle Wise, Use
Wise, Location Wise, Gender Wise, Age Wise: The various factors, which
affect the risk, are based on correlation of the factors with the risk
proneness.</p>
<p>US markets use 75+ risk factors, Japan market use 9+ risk factors, UK
20+ Recently proposed tariff rates for Malaysia are based on nine rating
factors viz. use of vehicle, number of drivers, age of vehicle, make of
vehicle, geographical location, driver's sex, engine capacity, number
of claim-free years, sum insured.</p>
<p>ii. Risk segmentation guidelines in Japan Age of driver Gender Driving

less any kind discount on no. of automobiles insured air bags, anti-

<p>iii. Indian market rating Indian market rating has been based on just 4
risk factors, which by and large are used in the current market as guide
rates. The discounts are based on performance of motor portfolio and
competition in the market to retain market share although the claims
continue to be prejudiced by several factors [(Test Drive by Govind
Johri, Associate Professor in Asia Insurance Post, January and February
2008 p. 48-49]. The underwriter is required to collect relevant data on
various factors which affect the claims taking into consideration
following factors:
(a) The Vehicle (i) Registration details  Year of manufacture  Age
of vehicle (ii) Insured declared value (iii)Model guidelines vis-a-vis

settlement plans (vii)Innovation Of Product d) The Vehicle The
underwriting approach differs according to the type of vehicle e.g., age
of vehicle, value of vehicle, technology, use of IT, Colour etc. As seen
earlier, vehicles are classified, according to their use into private
cars, motor cycles, scooters and commercial vehicles.</p>
<h2 id="iyear-of-manufacture--insureds-declared-value-idv">i.Year of manufacture &amp; Insured's Declared Value (IDV)</h2>
<p>The first important point to be considered is the year of manufacture,
the purchase price and the insured's declared value. The insured's
declared value in relation to the age of the vehicle is very important
factor as the consumer courts come on insurers heavily, if the IDV is
found lower then agreed formula, to protect the interest of Policy
holder. It is especially because, there being no pro-rata condition of
average in the policy and the sum insured is the limit of liability per
accident and not for the period of insurance. The majority of motor
claims are for partial damage and the absence of pro-rata condition of
average adversely affects the insurers where the use of vehicle is
considerably different affecting usual wear and tear.</p>
<h2 id="ii-age-of-the-vehicle">ii. Age of the vehicle</h2>
<p>The age of the vehicle is important feature from the
underwriting point of view. It is natural that, as a vehicle becomes
older, defects appear more frequently and metal fatigue sets in. The
underwriting guidelines adopted differ from insurer to insurer, but
there is broad agreement in the approach adopted. Private cars which are
over 15 years old are not accepted on comprehensive terms but covered
for third party risks only. Fire and Theft risks may however, be
covered. Cars which are over 10 years and less than 15 years old are
accepted for comprehensive risks subject to satisfactory inspection
report by the insurer's automobile engineers or other officials or
independent surveyors. The inspection report would cover the condition
of the engine, body work, and the efficiency of the brakes, tyres,
steering and general maintenance of the vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="iii-model-guidelines--for-age-of-vehicle">iii. Model Guidelines  for Age of Vehicle:</h2>
<p>During the tariff regime, in the 1980&rsquo;s the insurers
had evolved model guidelines for acceptance of other vehicles vis-a-vis
their age, these were as follows; Taxies-Fresh Acceptances -
Comprehensive Cover (a) Up to 3 years for comprehensive cover. (b) Up to
5 years subject to inspection and satisfactory claims experience. (c)
Over 5 years, up to 7 years on inspection with a further compulsory
excess of Rs. 500/- (without any discount); over 7 years ‗Act only'
policy. (d) Renewal is on normal terms subject to satisfactory claims
experience up to 10 years old vehicles; over 10 years renewals are
offered on Act only.</p>
<h2 id="commercial-vehicles---fresh-proposals---comprehensive-cover">Commercial vehicles - fresh proposals - comprehensive cover</h2>
<h2 id="a-goods-carrying-vehicles-own-goods">(a) Goods Carrying Vehicles (Own Goods)</h2>
<p>(i) Up to 5 years package policy. (ii)
Over 5 and up to 7 years subject to satisfactory inspection report
package policy. (iii) Over 7 years and up to 10 years subject to
satisfactory inspection report and a compulsory excess of Rs. 2,500/-;
over 10 years ‗Act only&rsquo; policy. (iv) Disposal vehicles on inspection
and subject to further compulsory excess of Rs. 500/- (without any
discount). (v) Renewal is to be offered with normal terms subject to
satisfactory claims experience up to a period of 12 years; over 12 years
renewals will be on ‗Act only&rsquo; policy. (b) Public Carriers (i) Up to 5
years for package policy. (ii) Over 5 years and up to 6 years, subject
to inspection report and</p>
<p>satisfactory claims experience or additional compulsory excess without
discount. (iii) Over 7 years ‗Act only&rsquo; policy. (iv) Renewals to be
offered with normal terms subject to satisfactory claims</p>
<p>experience up to a period of 10 years. (v) Over 10 years renewals will
be on ‗Act only&rsquo; policy.</p>
<p>Most of these guidelines are still followed with minor adjustments
keeping in mind individual companies risk acceptance philosophy and
overall claims experience.</p>
<h2 id="iv-auto-crash-test-compliance">iv. Auto Crash Test Compliance</h2>
<p>The compliance with safety standards in
vehicles is a crucial factor for rating risk. Auto Crash tests are an
important factor. It is based on UN Standards and individual country
standards. These tests are conducted by global car safety watch dog,
global New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) in association with Institute
of Road Traffic Education (IRTE) and the World Bank. The cars are driven
at 56 kmph and 64 kmph (NCAP standard) against a static object and its
impact is studied for safety of driver and occupants. India is one of
the signatories to the UN standard for safe vehicles (R94) which
prescribes 56 kmph crash test although the government has not mandated
the test so far. At present all cars in India are checked for front and
rear impact when they are being driven at 48 kmph and the bar is being
considered for raise to 56 km/ ph by 2015 when India proposes to have
its own NCAP norms with full body test, instead of front and rear, at a
facility coming up in Chennai. Even the low standards are not met by
popular cars like Volkswagen, Tata Nano, Alto 800 and Hyundai besides
Polo without air bag, which have failed the UN Standard Tests, while the
manufacturers maintain that they are complying with Indian Norms and are
selling cars with airbags and additional safety variants&rsquo;; the same
manufacturers produce vehicles of very high standard complying rigorous
UN norms, when they export vehicles to other countries, manufactured in
India. The lack of compliance with global NCAP norms for crash test is
contributing to increased liability to be borne by insurers for
increased number of loss of life and increasing number of total loss
claims.</p>
<h2 id="v-colour-of-the-vehicle">v. Colour of the vehicle</h2>
<p>The colour of the vehicle is also considered for rating purpose, as international studies have found that
black, red, or yellow painted cars are more prone to accidents, while
white cars are more prone to thefts.</p>
<h2 id="vi-military-disposal-vehicles">vi. Military Disposal Vehicles</h2>
<p>Inspection is also insisted on before acceptance of military disposal
vehicles and where requests are received for conversion from 'third
party risks' only policy to Package covers at renewal or during the
currency of the policy.</p>
<h2 id="vii-insurance-on-imported-cars">vii. Insurance on imported cars:</h2>
<p>It requires consideration of several
other factors. There is a problem of obtaining spare parts. The costs of
repair of an imported car are also high, not only because of the cost of
materials but because of the intricate design which would mean more time
spent on dismantling or reassembling. Such cars not older than 10 years
are accepted on comprehensive terms subject to an 'excess'. Some
insurers exclude damage to the windscreen. The policy is invariably
subject to the following endorsement: &quot;It is hereby understood and
agreed notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this policy
that in the event of loss or damage to the Motor Vehicle and/or its
accessories necessitating the supply of a part not obtainable from
stocks held in the country in which the Motor Vehicle is held for repair
or in the event of the Company exercising the option under Condition No.
.&hellip; to pay in cash the amount of the loss or damage the liability of
the Company in respect of any such part shall be limited to: (a) The
price quoted in the latest catalogue or price list issued by the
Manufacturer or his Agents for the country in which the Motor vehicle is
held for repair, or If no such catalogue or price list exists, last
price quoted by the Manufacturer's plus the reasonable cost of
transportation otherwise than by air to the country in which motor
vehicle is held for repair and the amount of the relative import duty.
(b) The reasonable cost of fitting such parts is subject otherwise to
the terms, exceptions conditions and limitations of this Policy. This
means that for imported vehicles where parts are not available in the
country, the cost for replacement will be the price listed by the
manufacturers in their catalogue as the price for of sale to that
country plus reasonable cost of transport charges and custom duties. Air
freight is not covered.</p>
<p>Example A Bentley car has a part to be replaced and the manufacturers
catalogue lists the price of that part for India as Euro 7900/-. Thus
the price allowed will be the equivalent rupee value for Euro 7900 +
Shipping freight + Customs duty payable for importing the item. The
labour cost for fitting will also be allowed.</p>
<p>Imported cars over 10 years and less than 15 years old are accepted on
Package cover terms subject to higher excess. Such cars over 15 years
old are accepted for ‗Third Party liability cover only&rsquo;. Cars imported
by foreign embassies pose a special problem in as much as the embassies
are exempt from paying customs duty on the imported cars and, as such
will attract sum insured for less than their market price. To counteract
the adverse effect of under-insurance, the Insurers load the Own Damage
to vehicle premium on such cars by at least 15% to 30%.</p>
<h2 id="viii-sports-cars">viii. Sports cars</h2>
<p>Sports cars are considered to be heavier risks than other cars of
the normal type. The repair costs are likely to be higher. These cars
which are specially designed for usage at high speed are usually driven
by ‗young drivers&rsquo; from ‗affluent families&rsquo;. The loss severity will be
high because of the high speed and carefree attitude. Each case is
decided on the individual merits and acceptance is subject to an excess,
exclusion of personal accident benefits and loading of premium. In some
cases, driving may be restricted to named persons.</p>
<h2 id="ix-extra-fittings">ix. Extra fittings</h2>
<p>If the car is fitted with luxury items e.g. TV, DVD players, refrigerators
etc. then there is the added risk of theft. Before acceptance, full
details of the luxury fittings including the make, model and separate
values for each item, are obtained. In the present day motor vehicles
come with these fitting with standard models. The values are included in
the manufacturers selling price. In such cases the value is part of IDV.
There is no need to declare these items under extra fittings for
insuring them separately.</p>
<h2 id="x-distance-travelled">x. Distance travelled</h2>
<p>The distance travelled by the vehicle is also a factor of underwriting importance. A
disproportionately higher average run (for example tourist taxis loging
higher run compared to private cars) would signify greater wear and
tear. It will also mean more extensive damages in the event of a claim.
This would require putting higher depreciation for partial replacements.
The IDV in current scenario being based on manufacturers selling price
subject to pre decided depreciation percentage cannot be adjusted unless
agreed to accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="e-the-use-of-the-vehicle">e) The Use of the Vehicle</h2>
<p>i. The risk exposure due to the purpose for
which the vehicle is used e.g., vehicles used in shifts, vehicle used
for sports purpose are taken care of in the rating systems. The use to
which vehicles are to be put, even those of the same class, is a
deciding factor in the relative degree of risk involved. ii. Private
Cars represent a lighter risk than Taxies which are subject to optimum
utilisation. Owner-driven taxies are a better risk than those which are
driven by paid drivers on salary or commission. The latter may not have
any interest in the maintenance of the vehicle or in its safe operation.
iii. Private carriers are considered a better risk than public carriers.
The use of the former is limited to carriage of own goods, whereas
public carriers like the taxies, are subject to optimum utilisation
including driving during night hours, thus are exposed to higher
incidence of accidents and wear and tear. iv. Private carriers are also
better maintained. Even in same class of vehicles, the exposure to
similar risk may differ with another. Goods carrying vehicle used for
delivery of aerated water bottles from door to door in a city will not
be such a heavy risk, as a lorry engaged in interstate transportation of
goods. v. The general nature of the goods carried is important for
underwriting purposes, especially if they are flammable or likely to
explode. The fire hazard is common with, for example, vehicles used for
bulk conveyance of petroleum (Tanker vehicles). If a vehicle is
maintained periodically it is bound to be a better risk compared to when
needed which is a bad risk. Similarly if a vehicle is repaired with
authorised or genuine spare parts it is bound to improve risk. This also
gives rise to a question whether cheapest claims settlement is good for
vehicle safety or the vehicle is safe on the point of subsequent claim
and extent of loss.</p>
<h2 id="f-the-area-of-operation">f) The Area of Operation</h2>
<h2 id="i-parking-location">i. Parking Location</h2>
<p>The normal parking location of the vehicle is also an important consideration. Even daily
car parking spot (whether closed, open or road side parking) may have a
bearing on the premium. The vehicle is exposed to vagaries of nature
like sun, rain and winds which results in extra wear and tear. In
addition if the vehicle is parked in public areas and not within
residential or business premises, the risk of theft of the vehicle or
partial damages by passing vehicles or public is increased.</p>
<h2 id="ii-zones">ii. Zones</h2>
<p>Different geographical area, long distance driving etc., are prone to
different level of exposure. Where one lives matters? Living in rural
area is far less likely to have a collision but more of cars are stolen
from such rural areas. Moving across the street can change the rate
depending upon probability of accident. Therefore, segmentation of risk
zone is an important underwriting factor. Probability &amp; Severity
Analysis can be measured for different geographical segment. The area in
which the vehicle is used has a direct bearing upon the risk under all
sections of cover of the package policies. This aspect of physical
hazard is also taken care of in the rating system. The Rating would
differ according to the zones for use of vehicle, e.g. metropolitan
areas, state capitals, major cities, and Urban and Rural areas.
Similarly rating must take in account: (a) Climate of the area (cold
regions, arid, hot) Rural Area theft prone; Urban Area more WEAR &amp; tear)
(b) Hill Area (Heavy Recovery cost &amp; inevitable towage) (c) Coastal Area
(Maintenance), Hill, Desert, Plain, High (d) High way usage (prone to
higher accidents) (e) Metro Area, Local movement (f) Theft prone areas
This differential rating should also takes into account density of
population, density of road traffic, type and quality of roads over
which the vehicles would normally ply etc. g) The Driver of the Vehicle
Apart from the physical aspect of the vehicle and its usage, the driving
element is a dominating feature in relation to motor insurance which has
an important bearing upon the loss ratio.</p>
<h2 id="ipersonal-hazard-of-the-driver">i\Personal hazard of the driver:</h2>
<p>Although physical aspect is taken care of in the rating system but the
personal hazard of the driver should also be taken into consideration to
ensure lesser accidents and consequent lower liabilities. The proposal
form can never indicate the temperament of an individual or his driving
habits. This can be ascertained from the claims experience; history of
meeting with accidents and conviction for traffic offences. Minor
conviction for speeding or parking may be ignored but a number of such
convictions may indicate both recklessness and indifference to the law
on the part of the proposer. In such cases, restrictive cover may be
granted. It is essentially the driver who is responsible for good or bad
claims in motor insurance. By careful driving and by taking a pride in
his vehicle, an insured can substantially reduce loss possibilities.
Neglect, carelessness and risk aversion index of driver/owner are major
factors which are responsible for bad claims experience. Insurers can
charge motor insurance premiums based on the drivers' traffic record,
through electronic link to the traffic departments via a portal.</p>
<h2 id="ii-common-defects-of-vision">ii. Common defects of vision</h2>
<p>All proposal forms incorporate a question to
elicit whether, to the best of the proposer's knowledge and belief, he
or any other person who to his knowledge will drive, suffers from
defective vision or hearing or from any physical defect. Common defects
of vision which can be corrected by spectacles or contact lens are
ignored. The loss of sight in one eye is much more serious as it impairs
the field of vision and judgement of distances. Deafness which can be
overcome by the use of hearing aids is ignored by the underwriter. Loss
of limb introduces considerable hazards. Such physically challenged
drivers are able to drive cars which are specially adapted for their
use. Insurance is granted in such cases including the type of cover
depending upon several factors such as the gadgets fixed in such cars,
age of the car, nature and locality of use, etc. Therefore, the concerns
of underwriter are: (a) How to deal with a young driver? (b) How to deal
with a new driver? (c) How to deal with female driver? (d) How to deal
with careless driver? (e) What should be done with the insured that pays
scant attention to the upkeep of the vehicle so long as it is reasonably
fit for his purposes?</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that these factors could be regarded as moral
hazards in the wider sense of carelessness and can be dealt with by the
underwriter. The hazard arising from the driver could be assessed from
the point of view of his gender, age, physical condition, occupation,
driving experience/and history of meeting with accidents.</p>
<h2 id="iii-age-of-driver">iii. Age of driver</h2>
<p>Age has a material bearing on the risk of driver. Oldest
octogenarian and the youngest drivers are far more likely to have
accidents compared to mature looking teens. The young drivers due to
their love for speed and dare devil approach present an unfavorable
hazard because speed has a special attraction for youth. Similarly, an
elderly driver involves increased physical hazard, because of advancing
age, the faculties are less keen resulting in slower reactions which may
have serious consequences in the event of an emergency. It has been
found that the claim costs for drivers under 25 are approximately 1.5 to
2.5 times the costs for drivers over 35.</p>
<h2 id="iv-driving-experience">iv. Driving experience</h2>
<p>The driving experience may indicate accident-proneness. It is found that
numerous claims occur with new drivers because of their limited driving
experience. Another great menace on the road is not the new driver but
the experienced driver who is reckless and foolhardy and will take risks
which the new motorist would never do.</p>
<h2 id="v-driving-history">v. Driving History</h2>
<p>The number of years of driving experience, miles driven per year affects the accident
proneness of a driver. It is important to know accidents History of the
driver, whether driver is holding a fresh or old license, whether the
license is appropriate for the vehicle driven, and the verification of
drivers address and if the vehicle is Owner driven or his family members
also drive. It must also be noted if night driving is involver or 24 hrs
driving in case of taxi or private cars. Vehicles used in shift have to
be taken in account while underwriting the risk.</p>
<h2 id="vi-driving-violations">vi. Driving Violations</h2>
<p>Like convictions, speeding youngsters, running over red lights, failure
to yield to traffic rules, etc. are also important for prudent
underwriting.</p>
<h2 id="vii-training-of-drivers">vii. Training of drivers</h2>
<p>The education level of the driver is a new
factor incorporated by insurers as a potential risk factor. Proposal
forms are now eliciting such information. The technological advances in
vehicle manufacture have resulted in installation of computerized
systems for operation of vehicles. Drivers are required to have
knowledge about the operating systems especially of Commercial vehicles.
In order to improve the driving on roads, drivers who have undergone
training through recognised ―Motor Training School‖ may be given
discount in premium.</p>
<h2 id="viii-gender-of-the-driver">viii. Gender of the driver</h2>
<p>The gender of the driver has also a bearing on underwriting. Internationally, female drivers are
considered better risks than male drivers and premium rates are
discounted for such drivers. This practice has now been adopted by a few
insurers in India. Women statistically make safer drivers which could be
mothering instinct or indulging in lesser fantasies. Claim costs for
males are 5% to 10% higher than females, with sex and age factors
tending to interact together. However, there are no reports of people
marrying simply to lower their insurance rates or vice versa. Marital
status hardly affects driving habits and there are hardly any statistics
about increased number of accidents while returning home.</p>
<h2 id="ix-occupation-of-the-proposer">ix. Occupation of the proposer</h2>
<p>The occupation of the proposer has also a material
bearing on the risk. For example, Pizza delivery guy could be a higher
risk; person engaged in the entertainment professions represent a
hazardous class of risk. They use their cars for long and hurried
journeys; their hours of work are irregular; and they may be required to
drive at night or in the early hours of the morning. More accidents
occur while returning from job and continuous driving for weeks by
commercial vehicle drivers under National Permits due to stress and
fatigue.</p>
<h2 id="x-credit-rating">x. Credit Rating</h2>
<p>Poor credit position relates to higher risk.
If there is no credit history, it is suggestive of single vehicle owner,
who is financially incapable to get repairs, may try for Total Loss or
Constructive Total Loss. The Fleet owners having high credit rating
cross subsidise among vehicles and are entitled to reduction in premium.</p>
<h2 id="h-the-claims-experience">h) The claims experience</h2>
<p>The history of past losses reveals the nature
of losses e.g., if the vehicle is stolen frequently, it would be an
indicator of poor security arrangements or susceptibility of the place
or of the vehicle being prone to thefts due to available alternate use
of some machinery parts. Similarly, in case of frequent accidents,
details of the parts of the vehicle affected would give a clue as to
whether the vehicle is in a good state of repairs and running condition
or there is an element of moral hazard of the insured in claiming
losses. The past losses, therefore, permit the insurer to decide the
scope of cover to be granted or to impose certain conditions or
additional deductibles; so that the exposure to the risk is reasonably
measurable and preventive steps are taken at the time of acceptance of
the proposal. The data will have to be analysed with a sense of right
perspective. A single serious and major claim need not be a matter of
concern, but a string of minor accidents over a period of five years is
definitely unsatisfactory experience. Such proposals may be accepted
with a higher 'excess'. Claims experience is also to be considered at
the time of renewal. The approach adopted for acceptance of new proposal
is equally applicable for renewal business. If the loss experience of
'own damage' claims is bad, then renewal will have to be offered on
the basis of 'excess' or restricted cover. All proposal forms elicit
full particulars of settled and outstanding claims in connection with
any motor vehicle owned or driven by the proposer during the last
preceding 3 to 5 years. Information is required to be submitted
separately for 'own damage' claims, third party claims and other
claims. Insurers are in the process of setting up a common database of
all vehicles insured by them to ensure that record of claims experience
for OD can be verified and insured appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="i-no-claim-discount">i) No claim discount</h2>
<p>Insurers have found that granting of no claim discount is a powerful
strategy to improve underwriting experience. Today it forms an integral
part of rating systems. The no claim discount is usually opposed by
insurance underwriters brought up in the traditions of other departments
where scientific tariffs have been developed. They find it difficult to
reconcile their approach with a system of rating which allow discount
off the premium in the event of no claim having been made upon the
policy. Their argument is that this discount is a negation of an
inherent principle of insurance viz. the premiums are paid by the many
into a pool from which the claims of few are paid.</p>
<p>It is not fair that though for over several years the insured has had
the protection for which he has paid the premium, is being rewarded
because the peril against which he has been covered, has not arisen. The
other arguments advanced are: i. It creates extra clerical work for
insurers in calculation of premiums and preparation of renewal notices -
work which is out of all proportion to its value. ii. It leads to many
disputes between the insured and insurers, e.g. claims settled under
knock-for-knock agreement. The insured who considers himself blameless
would resent the forfeiture of his discount. iii. At any rate the policy
contains a condition that the insured shall take all reasonable steps to
safeguard the vehicle from loss or damage and maintain it in efficient
condition. He has also to act, under Common Law, as if he is uninsured;
it is therefore, inconsistent to offer a further incentive to care. The
arguments favouring no claim discounts are: i. As mentioned earlier,
while physical hazard is of importance in motor insurance, the personal
hazard of the driver is just equally important. The no claim discount
goes a little, if not a long way, in recognising this factor. There have
been innumerable instances of insured bearing the cost of a small
accident in preference of forfeiting his discount, either because the
amount of the prospective discount or because he was desirous of
maintaining a good record. Thus the discount acts as an effective
incentive to the insured to exercise care. ii. Indirectly, the discount
helps towards contribution to the object of road safety. iii. The
disputes between the insured and the insurer are not common as is
thought of. At any rate, the tariffs permit discretion to the insurers
to allow no claim discount, when they are satisfied that the claim is
being solely by virtue of the knock-for-knock agreement and that the
insured was free of blame for the accident.</p>
<h2 id="j-moral-hazard">j) Moral Hazard</h2>
<p>Moral hazard is, perhaps, more important in underwriting motor insurance than in any
other class of insurance. As mentioned earlier, the owner or driver of a
motor vehicle is more responsible for bad claims experience, than the
physical condition of the vehicle or the use to which it is put or the
area in which it is used.</p>
<p>It is in rare cases that mechanical breakdown causes road accidents. It
is the attitude, the temperament and the personality of the driver that
is responsible for accidents. While considering acceptance of new
business proposals, it may not be easy to ascertain all aspects of moral
hazard. But his behaviour and attitudes during the currency of the
policy and when a claim arises, will be indicative of bad moral hazard.
And this aspect will have to be borne in mind at the time of renewal.</p>
<p>Example The insured may not co-operate with the insurer in respect of a
third party claim. He may not appear in the Tribunal or may not insist
on his driver to do so. In the event of 'own damage' he may insist on
replacements and repairs not strictly connected with the accident and
may be unwilling to contribute towards the cost of such replacement and
repairs. He may be careless in reporting accidents hoping that no claim
will materialise from the third party. With such insured renewal will
have to be invited subject to underwriting safeguards, e.g. restriction
of cover, imposition of compulsory excess, etc.</p>
<h2 id="k-other-factors-in-determining-premiums">k) Other factors in determining premiums</h2>
<p>i. Auto Insurance: Whether or not you currently have coverage for named
drivers or unnamed, excess imposed if any, NCD earned.</p>
<p>ii. Vehicle Safety Features: Theft Protection Devices; Alarm
immobilizer; Night parking in closed Garage/ or road side. iii. Multiple
Cars and Drivers is another opportunity for Discounts/ Loadings
depending upon the increased exposure due to multiple drivers using same
cars. iv. Sub Classification- helps at time of claim. (a) Purpose of
Registration &ndash; Sumo Qualis, Mahindra Zeep mostly for commercial
purpose. (b) Commercial private use &ndash; vehicles having yellow plates,
but solely used for private purpose i.e., to carry its own employees/
staff ( not for hire or reward ). (c) Having private permit (d) It is
wrong to issue Commercial/Passenger / Tourist Taxi Policies (e) Vehicle
registered in the name of institution/Firm but used for carrying
employees/Directors / Executives</p>
<p>v. Road Categories: Poorly maintained roads and malfunctioning traffic
control signals, failure of duty of municipal department, their
negligence, improper design, maintenance, construction, signage,
lighting or other highway defects, including poorly placed trees and
utility poles. vi. Different Settlement Plans With depreciation; without
depreciation; without bills; on site OD /TP settlements also incur cost,
therefore, are important factors in underwriting. vii. Innovation of
Product like per KM basis of insurance; repair options;, Courtesy Car,
Enhanced Courtesy Car, Total Loss /Constructive Total Loss on 60% or 75
% repair estimate basis; repairs in Authorised Garage or Road side or
Middle Level Garage and any other car driven by owner to have Legal
liability or Own Damage &amp; Third Party both. viii. Real skill of the
Underwriter: The real skill of underwriter is tested in the following
areas: (a) Creating wording of the endorsement and eating. (b)
Acceptance of high end vehicles; (c) Ascertaining use of special purpose
vehicles, (d) Break-in-insurance &ndash;inspection of vehicles (e) Updated
data of secondary market of vehicles (f) Cost at the time risk proposed.
l) Accident repairing cost Factors are to be assessed for Post
Automotive Repair: (a) Labour charges/Time schedule &amp; Rate (b) Painting
component/ technology (c) Spare part pricing Manufacturers/Dealers'
current strategy is to earn profits through accident repair jobs at the
insured&rsquo;s cost. Over charging to insurers need to be eliminated by
replacing the current ‗Live and Let Die&rsquo; policy by ‗Live and Let Live'
approach. We need to identify accident prone parts, claim prone parts
and spare part price revision pattern, including PML concept.</p>
<p>Insurers must initiate: (a) Dialogue with manufacturer on all above
mentioned factors (b) Study model design; positional structure of
accident prone parts, electronic parts, turbo etc. (c) Identify standard
of accident repairing facilities and (d) Evaluate competence of the
dealers e.g. Body parts, frames, axles etc. (e) Liaison with Police and
Telecommunication network (f) Coordination with judicial Agencies (g)
Coordination with research and approval Agencies and Automobile
Associations Since these are the real consideration factors to price the
individual product methodically for viability, better understanding will
prevail. Each model wise risk assessment is a must. Broadly speaking
there is a scope for reduction of present rating while liability premium
needs to be loaded. This is only possible for insurers who have a desire
to manage the portfolio scientifically; to find out general accident
rate and claim reporting rate and control &amp; eliminate the leakage
resulting in excess outgo. i. Motor Insurance Statistics: As rates of
premium are based on past loss experience, it is most essential to
maintain a detailed statistical structure for Motor insurance. This is
of great importance in a detariffed regime. It is therefore, being dealt
with in a separate chapter. ii. Data Collection: The data has to be
collected for future use for class of vehicle, retaining same
classification; same zones; age of vehicle, type of body; Carrying
Capacity, and new band width that have been introduced. The data is also
to be collected relating to vehicle on specific types fuels, PAN number,
colour of the vehicle; owner details on occupation, age of the owner,
address, gender; driver related data on age, education, experience,
place of issue of driving licence; commercial vehicles (both types of
vehicle) related data for type of permit viz. national, stage, contract,
any other; use of vehicle viz private service, public service,
educational institution, goods carriage, all vehicles data about copy of
Registration certificate / Sale certificate, driving licence, personal
accident cover to owner driver, driving licence, nominee of owner driver
and for commercial vehicles (PSV) carrying capacity as per permit.</p>
<p>The data about liability section in Commercial vehicles for Conductor/
Ticket examiner, Passenger in Public Service Vehicle (as per carrying
capacity in Permit), Persons carried in goods vehicle (as per Permit);
Third Party Property Damage as per Act liability Limit to be taken
maximum up to Rs. 2.5 / 7.50 Lacs.</p>
<h2 id="m-competitive-premium--setting-model">m) Competitive premium -setting model</h2>
<p>The competitive premium-setting model is expected to ensure neither
excessive pricing nor non-viable premium through undercutting. There is
also a need for restructured policy Terms / Conditions besides emphasis
on language and fine print are to be made simpler to be understood by
all stake holders. i.</p>
<p>New add-On Covers for Loss of keys and loss of transport e.g. Loss of
use, Substitute vehicle with similar or lower model of car or without
car, Conveyance expenses, Loss of income/profit through business
interruption etc. is need of the time.</p>
<p>ii. Repair time schedule data is to be built up vis-à-vis assessment of
the repair time. For Competitive viable pricing for all this to stay
ahead in the market companies will have to develop spesialisation either
in-house or by outsourcing. Competition will be fierce in free market
and only those underwriters will emerge winners who will adopt
‗Scientific Control Methods&rsquo; both in damage to vehicle and Third Party
segments &amp; ensure that they meet their corporate governance norms. The
existing leakages will have to be eliminated. Companies will have to be
aggressive in their marketing strategies. This will pose a real
challenge to each company. Those who do not adopt such governance will
be fighting for survival. iii. Scientific Control: The challenge for
insurers is to keep stricter scientific control over following three
areas.</p>
<p>Intermediaries performance In-house claim handlers attitude Surveyors'
performance Advocates&rsquo; performance</p>
<p>Challenge ahead is to have professional motor managers, without any
compromise. In the free market era, there is no scope for casual
inefficient approach. The management of motor portfolio may follow any
pattern, but for the effective management scientific risk management
will have to be enforced strictly with precision. Therefore, only option
is to evolve specialised scientific methods for damage to vehicle &amp;
Third party claims liability management and ensure its enforcement. 174</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The policy holders &amp; businesses are complaining steep hikes. Transporters
are facing difficulties for compulsory third party coverage. Insurers
are still finding premiums inadequate. The Market is highly Competitive,
tending towards aggressive marketing, with innovative products, and
intervention of IT governance in customer services. Stringent Regulatory
Norms ( Solvency norms, Protection of Policy Holders&rsquo; Interest &amp;
Shareholders&rsquo; Interests), end of Soft Market Regime and restrictions
from Reinsurance Market, Change in Legal Environment, Rising Customers
Expectations and Increasing Consumerism are taking its toll.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Indian Motor Insurance market</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The Indian motor insurance market is ridden with
lack of sound underwriting policy, lack of IT compatibility of data
extraction &amp; analysis and to convert the data into usable electronic
form to analyse true cost of motor risk. Lack of experience in free
pricing regime relates to factors associated with policy holder,
associated with the vehicle, relating to coverage aggravating risk
including factors that can&rsquo;t be measured like risk aversion and repeated
traffic violations for want of any mechanism and factors which can be
measured in theory but are impractical to find correlation. Current
market constitutes high value cars which do not increase in risk
exposure on a linear scale, but tend to flatten out after a certain
point. While the relativity of 40% may be reasonable for the larger
cities, we would expect a similar pattern in other heavily populated
areas such as Chennai and Bangalore, which currently charge lower rates.
Basis of rates in India is engine capacity and carrying capacity of the
vehicle, Sum insured; and Geographical location. India after
deregulation of market is geared to adopt a selective pricing and
marketing approach, targeting profitable segments and avoiding
loss-making ones.</p>
<p>The claim costs for some suburban areas are 20% to 40% higher than for
others, under a possible strategy in the short term. The need of the
hour is be quick in claims settlement and be aggressive in pricing
aspect. The premium-setting model is expected to ensure neither
excessive pricing nor non-viable premium through undercutting. The
Pricing mechanism should encourage reduction of losses.</p>
<h2 id="a-rating-factors">a) Rating factors</h2>
<p>Rating factor are those factors which have direct impact on out
go of insurers. These include variables which can be measured vis-a-vis
variables which cannot be measured but have substantial contributory
impact on vehicle damage or even third party liability and its extent or
those which cannot be measured at all.</p>
<h2 id="b-pricing-methodology">b) Pricing methodology</h2>
<p>Fundamental principle of insurance pricing is to receive sufficient
premiums to fund the expected claim costs, administrative costs,
acquisition cost, catastrophic cost, Deviation in cost if any say
Floods/ Earthquake; provide an expected profit to compensate cost of
obtaining the capital to support sale of coverage. Premium consists of a
pure premium to cover expected losses and Loss adjustment expenses. The
premium is to be loaded by operating expenses depend on the extent &amp;
variety of Policy holder services insurer agrees to provide e.g. Sales,
Commission; advertising expenses &amp; Taxes; Cost of handling claims,
allowances for contingencies covering margin &amp; interest incomes
including underwriting gain or profit needed to offer incentives in
competitive environment.</p>
<h2 id="c-the-pricing-objectives">c) The pricing objectives</h2>
<p>The three most important objectives of pricing relate to Premium adequacy, Fairness,
Simplicity, Consistency &amp; Flexibility. i. Premium adequacy is to
generate needed premium to pay for claims and management expenses.
Assure fair rate of return to the investor of the fund sufficient to
finance continuing growth and expansion by ensuring reasonableness or
just rate in competitive market. ii. Fairness must discriminate among
the buyers fairly; rates should not be same for hetro-groups like Saloon
cars and SUV&rsquo;s and must not differ for homogeneous groups like Maruti
cars of different models. iii. Simplicity, Consistency &amp; Flexibility:
Simple to understand &amp; inexpensive to use, rate must not change
frequently under daily changing circumstances (with claims reported
within certain period). 176</p>
<h2 id="d-type-of-rating-in-motor-insurance">d) Type of rating in motor insurance</h2>
<p>i. In motor insurance the risk
exposure is very rare so each risk is individually evaluated and rated
accordingly as per the underwriter&rsquo;s perception of the risk, termed as
judgement rating. ii. Motor risks are classified on the basis of some
features (Class rating) and are rated subjectively according to the
exposures dividing amount of incurred losses and loss adjustment
expenses by the number of exposure units. iii. When specific risk
differs within the same class, Merit Rating is carried out which
modifies class rate based on individual loss experience. In motor the
impact of age, gender leads to Schedule Rating or individual rating. The
accrual of NCB gives experience rating. It is different from
retrospective rating that modifies the insurance cost on the basis of
the current experience allowing refund or additional premium e.g.
adjustment of premium after the expiry of the policy. iv. Differential
Rating: Under differential rating the pricing is left to each Company
with freedom for including add-on covers. Differential rating is the
rating based on scientific method of pricing the product on Make and
Model basis. The most crucial aspect of rating in motor insurance is
claims cost. Therefore, every factor which adds to claims cost is of
utmost importance. v. New Features: If we peruse rating factors of high
tech vehicles, vehicle geometry and the relative situation of the parts,
sophistication in make and new features are also important while
determining motor insurance rates. Market for new vehicles tends to be
replacement oriented due to the monopoly of dealers and lack of skilled
labour in outside garages. Replacement items in each vehicle are
dependent on parts availability; spares cost valuation; obligatory
repairs and replacement to do committed repairs. Imported vehicles
repairs are difficult due to nonavailability of spares in local markets.</p>
<h2 id="e-motor-premium-rating">e) Motor premium rating</h2>
<p>The overall premium is equal to expected cost of
all claims + Expenses + required profit margin for all risks
underwritten. While ultimate claims cost is equal to paid losses +
reported outstanding losses + estimated IBNR costs.</p>
<p>The Motor premium rating is based on two principles. One is
determination of differential rating and other is pricing different risk
groups. The estimated ultimate cost of claims is determined by examining
past 2 to 3 accident Yrs. As the insurer has to apply rates for future
time, adjustment in actual cost is done for:  Expected future claims
inflation by examining past date of payment till claims are paid under
newly rated policies.  Expected future claims inflation by taking into
consideration changes in Policy Conditions between the past coverage &amp;
new policies based on more scientific approach.  Expected future claims
inflation for gap in receipt of premium &amp; claims payment for expected
investment earnings besides an allowance for direct &amp; indirect
administrative costs. This is more pronounced in third party claims
which take several years in final settlements. Finally the maturity,
deep experience, ability to lead the team, resist pressures, possesses
combination of experience, judgment and flair, acquiring knowledge is
not difficult, but to relate it to experience in the field and then to
utilize it for successful risk management is the effort worth putting.
Following 36 factors need close attention in Motor Premium rating : i.
Vehicles: 1. Make &amp; Model, 2. Age of vehicle, 3. Year of manufacture 4.
Insured&rsquo;s declared value, 5. Crash test compliance norms for each model,
6. Colour of the vehicle, ii. Use of vehicle: 7. Military disposal
vehicles 8. Imported cars 9. Sports cars 10. Extra fittings 12. Distance
travelled by the vehicle 13. Use as taxi/goods carrying, passenger or
miscellaneous vehicles. iii. Geographical area: 14. Topography of Area
e.g. hills, coastal region etc 15. Parking location 16. Density of
population 17. Density of road traffic 18. Quality and construction type
of roads. iv. Driver: 19. Gender 20. Driving experience 21. Age 22.
Health, Common defects of vision 23. Personal hazard of the driver and
habits 24. Traffic violations by drivers 25. Accident proneness of
driver. v. Proposer 26.Occupation 27. Claims experience 28. Using
multiple drivers and multiple vehicles 29. Credit rating of the insured
30. Moral hazard.</p>
<p>vi. Accident repairing facilities: 31. Garrage facilities 32.
Manufacturer&rsquo;s spare parts availability and pricing policy 33. Repair/
Replacement philosophy, 34. labour cost, 35.Repair time schedule data,
painting component). vii. Safety features: 36.GPRS tracking facility for
stolen vehicles</p>
<h2 id="f-model-wise-risk-assessment">f) Model wise Risk assessment</h2>
<p>Risk Assessment of each
model is to be assessed in arriving at premium rate model wise. The
underwriter has to take in account replacement items in each vehicle,
obligatory repairs and replacement required for committed repairs;
labour for work carried at road side garages, spares cost valuation;
availability of parts, etc. Therefore, all above mentioned factors are
very import. The, Insurers must initiate dialogue with manufacturer&rsquo;s as
parts are allowed at Manufacturer&rsquo;s List Price only if they are
purchased from the Authorised Dealers. i. Study model design; positional
structure of accident prone parts, electronic parts, turbo etc. ii.
Identify standard of accident repairing facilities at various Dealers&rsquo; /
other Govt. approved or composite garages and iii. Evaluate competence
of the dealers handling repairs e.g. Body parts, frames, axles etc. iv.
Liaison with Police and Telecommunication network v. Coordination with
judicial Agencies vi. Coordination with research and approval Agencies
and Automobile Associations Since these are the real consideration
factors to price the individual product methodically for viability,
better understanding will prevail. Each model wise risk assessment is a
must. Broadly speaking in general there is definite scope for reduction
of present rating while liability premium needs to be loaded This is
only possible for those insurers who have a desire to manage the
portfolio scientifically; to find out general accident rate and claim
reporting rate in India and control &amp; eliminate the leakage resulting in
excess outgo.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-4">Test Yourself 4</h2>
<p>Differential rating is the rating based on scientific
method of pricing the product on . I. Incremental basis II. Make and
Model basis III. Piecemeal basis IV. Claim formula</p>
<h2 id="g-motor-underwriting">G. Motor Underwriting</h2>
<p>Few years back the insurance regulator has to
permit reduction in Solvency ratio of the General Insurers who were
asked to absorb additional revised amounts for ensuring adequate
provisioning. The lack of compliance with global NCAP norms for Auto
Crash Test is contributing to loss of life and increasing number of
total loss claims to be borne by insurers. This information about
compliance with safety standards is crucial factor for rating the risk.
Motor is the largest portfolio of General Insurance segment and the
profitability of the entire insurance portfolio depends on how best
motor insurance is managed in de-tariff era for a vibrant insurance
market to emerge.</p>

<li>Underwriting scores methodology and its impact</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>While underwriting, various factors are identified and a score is
provided for each factor on a predetermined scale. Each factor is
analysed separately and its impact is converted into a score. The
favourable and adverse factor scores are added and a net score is found
out. The net score will allow the underwriter to decide whether to grant
cover, the type of cover and terms and conditions on which he is ready
to accept the business. Various score are in vogue which is provided by
insurance Marketing firms to enable insurers to arrive at a decision.</p>
<h2 id="a-insurance-risk-score">a) Insurance Risk Score</h2>
<p>When an insured applies for a car insurance policy
or submit a claim, he is probably unaware of the streams of his personal
information that flows between an Insurance Company and Insurance
Marketing Firms. Today, the true power lies in the hands of the database
companies that sell information about you. The &quot;credit scores&quot; used by
the auto insurance industries are actually &quot;Insurance Risk Scores.&quot;
Both scores are based on information contained in insured&rsquo;s full credit
report, but they put weight on different factors in order to calculate a
final score. Thus, even if a person purchases his credit score from one
of the major credit-reporting agencies, he still doesn&rsquo;t know his
&quot;insurance risk score.&quot;</p>
<p>A ‗credit score&rsquo; weighs data to determine, how one will become seriously
late in repaying to a lender. But ‗insurance scores&rsquo; are used to
evaluate ones past use of credit to predict how likely he is to make
claims in the future. If one has managed his credit well, he is likely
to manage his house and car well, resulting in fewer expensive claims.
‗Insurance scores&rsquo; do not factor in race or income. ‗Credit scores&rsquo; and
‗insurance scores&rsquo; generally move in the same direction as one&rsquo;s credit
history changes (meaning improving or worsening), but there could be
cases where one has credit activity that impacts one type of score more
than the other. Generally the insurance score calculation puts weight on
data this way: Payment history, collections, bankruptcy Amounts owed
Length of credit history New credit applications Type of credit used</p>
<p>40 percent 30 percent 15 percent 10 percent 5 percent</p>
<p>Most Auto insurers use ‗insurance scores&rsquo; to place the insured in a rate
class (like preferred, standard or high-risk) and set a price for him
within that class. There is a direct correlation between one&rsquo;s score and
the likelihood that he'll make a claim, at the same time it permits
insurers to charge higher premiums to lower income households. Most
countries have laws that restrict the use of credit scores and insurers
can't use the scores as the sole basis for setting rates or for
refusing to issue you a policy or renew your policy. If a person has
some unusual activity within the month before he buys car insurance, his
insurance score could drop. Insurers may then consider him as a bad risk
(where allowed by law) and refuse to sell him a policy, or charge him a
higher car insurance rates for it. There are many factors that auto
insurers use when evaluating their customer, including his driving
record, his claims history, where he lives and vehicle model etc.
‗Insurance Scores&rsquo; are based on credit reports. They are used by
insurers to help decide whether to sell a policy and if so what rate is
to be set. An Insured can know his score for a nominal cost and check
his insurance score and how it compares to other consumers and his
&quot;risk category.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="b-claims-score-automobile-loss-underwriting-reports">b) Claims Score, Automobile Loss Underwriting Reports</h2>
<p>‗Claims score&rsquo; are also sold to insurance companies which combines credit information
of insured and his previous claims history to predict future claims
level. ‗Automobile Loss Underwriting reports&rsquo; can be provided to
insurers containing up to a seven-year history of claims associated with
his auto insurance, including loss types, dates of loss, amounts paid,
and his past and present policy numbers, claim numbers and auto
insurers. An insured can receive this ―Automobile Loss underwriting
Report&quot; free once a year which he can dispute for inaccurate
information in it, much like a credit report. Other services to insurers
may include ‗motor vehicle reports&rsquo; and a ―Current Carrier&quot; database
that lists your current insurers, coverage&rsquo;s and limits. Insurance
Marketing firms can sell insurers access to its ‗Automobile Loss
Underwriting database&rsquo;, which may contain three to five years worth of
claims information on specific types of automobile losses.</p>
<h2 id="c-motor-vehicle-record">c) Motor vehicle record</h2>
<p>Motor vehicle record will include Motor
vehicle-registration details such as car's Registration number, engine
and chassis number, seating capacity/load carrying capacity, whether
owner have regular, dealer or vanity plates, whether the vehicle has
been titled as flood damaged, salvage, total loss etc., and other
vehicle data. &quot;Undisclosed-driver reports&quot; meaning &quot;hidden drivers&quot;
that are likely drivers of the insured car but not listed on policy
applications.</p>
<h2 id="d-insurers-own-model-of-scoring">d) Insurers Own Model Of Scoring</h2>
<p>Auto insurance companies
can have their own &quot;scores‖ like ―prior loss history and certain credit
characteristics&quot; to create its own model that will help it in
determining an underwriting score for a policyholder applying for a auto
policy. Insurance companies can combine credit characteristics and prior
claims history in these models using their own book of business. These
models are not designed to assess wealth, income or creditworthiness,
but focus on the prediction of future insurance losses.&quot; The &quot;use of
this model will lessen the extent to which those who represent higher
potential risk are subsidized by those who represent lower potential
risk.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="e-claim-search-system">e) Claim Search system</h2>
<p>Similarly a ‗Claim Search system&rsquo; can also be
made to detect fraud and to help insurers identify policyholder claims
histories. It is not used by insurers in deciding whether to sell a
policy or set rate, but it's used when claims are made. The Claim
Search system searches the database for other claims made by the same
person or business. If a series of claims look suspicious &mdash; for
example, the same name appears on all the claims with a different Aadhar
Card number &mdash; the system alerts the insurer to investigate further.</p>
