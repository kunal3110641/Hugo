<h2 id="a-types-of-motor-vehicles">A. Types of Motor Vehicles</h2>
<p>Meaning and classification of motor vehicles</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>A ―Motor Vehicle‖ has been defined in the Motor Vehicle Act
1988, Section 2 (27) as a mechanically propelled vehicle adapted for use
upon roads, whether power of propulsion is transmitted thereto, from an
external or internal source and includes a chassis to which a body has
been attached and a trailer, but does not include a vehicle running upon
fixed rails.
Classification of motor vehicles: For the purpose of
insurance, motor vehicles are classified into 3 broad categories, viz.
Private cars, Motorcycles and Commercial vehicles. There are also
sub-classifications in some of the categories.</p>
<h2 id="a-private-cars">a) Private cars</h2>
<p>Vehicles used solely for social, domestic and pleasure purposes and business or
professional purposes, but not for carriage of goods other than samples.
Three wheeled cars for private purpose are also covered.</p>
<h2 id="b-motor-cycles--scooters">b) Motor cycles / scooters</h2>
<p>Motor cycles / scooters are mechanically propelled two
wheelers with or without side car: Mechanically propelled three wheelers
with engine capacity not exceeding 350 cc.</p>
<h2 id="c-commercial-vehicles">c) Commercial vehicles</h2>
<p>The erstwhile Tariff defined and described these vehicles subject to further
rationalization vide IRDA/NL/ORD/MPL/077/03/2012 dated 29th March, 2012
and the categorization for the purpose of rating being followed in the
market is as follows:</p>
<p>Class A A-1 A-2 A-3 A-4</p>
<p>B C C-1 C-2 C-3 C-4 D E F G</p>
<p>Type of vehicle Goods Carrying Vehicles Public Carriers Private Carriers
Goods Carrying Motorised 3 Wheelers And Motorised Pedal Cycle (Public
Carriers) Goods Carrying Motorised 3 Wheelers And Motorised Pedal Cycle
(Private Carriers) and (i) Tractors, ii) Dumpers, iii) Milk vans, iv)
Oil and Petrol transport vehicles ; v) Refrigeration/ pre cooling units
; vi) Tankers; vii) Tippers predominantly used for commercial purpose.
(Earlier included in Class D vehicles). Trailers Public Passenger
Service Vehicles For Hire Or Reward 3 or 4 wheeler PPSV_PCC less than &lt;
6 (Taxis/Pvt. car type owned by Hotels &amp; hired by them to their guests)
4 or more wheeled PSV - more than PCC 6&gt; 3 wheeled psv _ pcc more than
17&gt; MOTORISED 3 WHEELD PSV LCC 6&gt; ,&lt; 17 FOR HIRE OR REWARD MOTORISED
2 WHEELED PSV FOR HIRE OR REWARD MISC &amp; SP TYPE 51 types of vehicle
included ROAD TRANSIT RISKS ONLY Motor Trade (ROAD RISKS) ONLY INTERNAL
RISK ONLY</p>
<p>a) Goods carrying vehicles These were earlier classified as ―Private
Carrier‖ and ―Public Carrier‖ and are used for commercial purpose.
According to the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, goods carrying vehicle is
called ―Goods Carriage‖. There is no categorisation of Public carrier
and Private carrier. However, they are still classified as public &amp;
private carrier for rating purposes under class A. b) Tankers These
vehicles are classified under class A-4. The tankers are used for
transport of non-solid goods viz., Liquids like water, Milk, edible
oils, Petroleum goods, chemicals, Bitumen etc. and as gases in liquid
form like LPG oxygen, Nitrogen etc. The tankers are built in the truck
itself or as trailer depending on the capacity and its usage. The
tankers are manufactured depending on the products, capacity and the law
governing the particular product.</p>
<h2 id="i-water-tankers">i. Water Tankers</h2>
<p>These are used for transportation of water is the
simplest and either rectangular or elliptical with / without full / half
baffle plates need no calibration. Tankers used for transportation of
petroleum products are governed by various acts viz., Explosive act,
Weight and Measures act (subject to calibration annually), generally of
12 KL or approx 9.6 MT capacity. The tanks have three or four
compartments and their front and rear end cover are called as Dish ends,
whereas partition sheets used are called Baffles mainly meant to reduce
the oscillation of liquid. The loading is done by gravity feed method
for majority of the goods such as kerosene, Petrol, Diesel and edible
oils. The inlet for the tankers carrying these types of goods will be
normally on top of every compartment. There are goods loaded only by
pressurised flow. These goods will be loaded only through ports filled
at the bottom of the tanks, ex. L.P.G. The outlet(s) of gravitational
fed loads are provided at the bottom of the tanks. The control of
outflow will be done by gate valves. A special feature is provided in
the petroleum carrier. A special shut of value arrangement is provided
for emergency purposes.</p>
<h2 id="ii-bitumen-tankers">ii. Bitumen Tankers</h2>
<p>These are also similar to the other tanks except that there are very special features are inbuilt.
Bitumen will be in solid form in normal condition. This material has to
be semi solid form for it to flow for loading and unloading. The hot
bitumen in semi solid form is loaded. The tanks are fitted with a
furnace to heat the bitumen inside the tank enabling it to become semi
solid form to flow out for unloading. Insulation is done around the tank
to maintain its temperature inside the tank. The insulating material is
covered by sheet metals.</p>
<h2 id="iii-milk-tankers">iii. Milk Tankers</h2>
<p>These are used for transportation of milk are constructed in stain less steel and few of
them are of refrigerated ones. The chemical carrying tanks will be lined
with FRP, Glass, Rubber, Plastic etc., depending on the individual
chemical and some of them are also insulated.</p>
<h2 id="iv-tankers-used-for-transportation-of-lpg">iv. Tankers Used For Transportation Of LPG</h2>
<p>These are tanks to transport gases and these are
governed by various Statutes. The products are LPG, Oxygen, Ammonia,
Nitrogen etc., and one such type of tank to carry is LPG Tank. The
products such as HSD, Petrol and kerosene are loaded at atmospheric
pressure while LPG is loaded at certain higher pressure. 68</p>
<p>All pressurised tanks will have safety valves. Temperature and Pressure
gauges are fitted in the tanks along with rotor gauge to find the level
of the liquid. Maximum 85% capacity is loaded. The loading pressure of
LPG is 10 KSCM, while filling pressure is 14.4 KSCM. Therefore,
manufacturer of LPG Tank is required to involve testing authorities from
day one i.e., selection of raw materials while manufacturing LPG Tanks.
The drawing &amp; Valves details of the Tank are furnished to Explosive
department for issuance of Certificate. AS LPG is highly explosive in
its nature, the government through the Controller of Explosives stress
the safety of the tank by involving third party agencies like M/s IES,
Bureau of VERITAS for inspection, from selection of sheets, up to the
end of manufacturer of Tank. Tests carried out during the manufacture of
tank are: (a) Ultrasonic Test: used to measure thickness of sheets (b) X
ray radiography test: quality of welding at butt welded joint (c) Stress
relieving test: for hardening carried out in hot oil or by injecting
flue gas and burning to increase temperature at 580-6000C maintained for
one hour. (d) Hydro test: by increasing the pressure to 1.3 times the
design pressure which is 14.5 KSCM c) Tippers These are goods carrying
transport vehicle used for carrying loose and bulk goods viz. mining
materials, sand, blue metals, coal etc. These tippers normally operate
for short distance only like Harbours, cement factories, Mines, Earth
work, Road work etc. and are 2 cu meters of load areas up to 100 cu
Meters presently working in mines. These vehicles have power take off
shaft in the gear box to drive the hydraulic pump which develops the
pressure used for lifting the load body with the help of telescopic
jack. The cabin for the tipper is almost similar to common truck. d)
Trailers These vehicles Section 2 (28) are classified under class B.</p>
<h2 id="definition-1">Definition</h2>
<p>Trailer is any truck, cart, carriage or other vehicle,
without means of selfpropulsion including agricultural implements drawn
or hauled by self-propelled vehicle. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>Trailers are of two types i. One version has axels at both the ends
coupled with tow bar arrangement or by fifth wheel coupling. ii. In
another version the rear portion will have the axel and the front
portion will be mounted on the prime mover. Trailers can also be
classified as: i. Trailers Used For Passenger Transport: the trailers
used for passenger transport are always similar in nature in body
construction. In goods transport, the trailers are connected with
various types of bodies&rsquo; viz. load body, platform, tanker and special
applications like asphalt mixing machines. ii. Running Gear: this is
also a kind of trailer but without the loading area. One end of the
loading compartment is mounted on the axle area of the running gear.
This does not possess any drive. Air for brake and electrical connection
is provided from the prime mover. This type of running gear is used in
the LPG tankers (articulated vehicle). The rear mounting beds of LPG
tanker will be mounted on the running gear. The number of axles (single
or double axles) in the running gear will be according to the load
carrying capacity of LPG tank. The other trailers will have main chassis
frame from the prime mover up to the rear end.</p>
<h2 id="e-passengers-carrying-vehicles">e) Passengers carrying vehicles</h2>
<p>All vehicles used for hire or reward with different registered
passenger carrying capacity are categorised under class C. These may be
metered or non-metered. They also include vehicles owned by hotels and
hired to guests. Three&ndash;wheeler motorized vehicles are also part of this
class of vehicle. f) Miscellaneous and special types of vehicles These
are categorised under class:  Ambulances  Breakdown Vehicles  Cinema
Film Recording &amp; Publicity Vans  Cranes Fitted with lift apparatus,
breakdown vehicles  Delivery Truck-pedestrian controlled  Dispensaries</p>
<p>Dust Carts, Water Carts, Road Sweepers etc  Excavators  Electric
Trolleys or  Fire Brigade &amp; Salvage Corps Vehicles  Footpath Rollers
Fork Lift Trucks  Hearses  Levelers  Mobile Shops &amp; Canteen Vehicles
Mobile Surgeries &amp; Dispensaries  Plane loaders  Refuse Carts  Road
Rollers, Road Sprinklers also used as Fire Fighting Vehicles  Site
clearing and leveling plant  Traction Engine Tractors &ndash; Angle Dozers,
Bull Dozers etc. Tractors Pedestrian Controlled  Tractors &ndash; used for
agricultural, forestry, tar spraying etc  Trailer fitted as Cinema Film
Recording and publicity Vans. Dust carts, water carts, Fire brigade,
mobile plants, mobile shops and canteen clearing and leveling plant, Tar
spraying g) Road transit risks only h) Motor trade (road risks) only i)
Internal risk only</p>
<p>Test Yourself 1 Which of the following test is used to measure thickness
of sheets? I. X-ray radiography test II. Ultrasonic test III. Stress
relieving test IV. Hydro test</p>
<h2 id="b-motor-insurance-documents">B. Motor insurance documents</h2>
<p>The process of insurance involves different
types of documents. From the time of acceptance of the risk, to the
settlement of the claim for loss or damage, specific written documents
are required. The main documents and their importance are detailed
below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proposal form</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The proposal form is the basis of motor
insurance contract. It is so designed as to elicit all information
necessary for a proper evaluation and for rating of the risk. The
questions commonly asked in proposal forms are: a) Particulars about the
proposer: i. Proposer's name in full to establish the identity of the
insured who is one of the parties to the contract, and may place the
insurer on enquiry concerning the moral hazard. ii. Address: The
proposer's address is necessary for communications and is a cross
checks on the area of use of the vehicle. iii. Occupation: The answer to
this question is important for underwriting private car and commercial
vehicle risk and has an important bearing on the moral hazard. The
answer is fair indication of the social status of the proposer and it
will provide some indication of the extent and for what purpose the
vehicle is likely to be used. iv. Physical disability and mental
infirmity: The answers to these questions are important, but it is
difficult to get precise answers particularly in respect of persons
other than the insured who may drive the car. v. Previous convictions: A
record of convictions for driving offences requires close
investigations. The enquiry is generally limited to a period of five
years. b) Details of vehicles to be insured: i. Registration letters and
numbers: For identification of the vehicles. ii. Make of the vehicle -
Engine and Chassis numbers: These are required for verification in case
of accident. iii. Year of manufacture: This is necessary because some
insurers do not give comprehensive cover for vehicles manufactured
earlier than a predetermined period or impose restrictions on older
vehicles. It also helps in the calculation of IDV for purpose of
insurance.</p>
<p>iv. Type of body, Seating Capacity and Cubic Capacity for private cars:
Rating is based on value and cubic capacity and Licensed Carrying
Capacity (goods or passengers), as the case may be, in case of
commercial vehicles. v. Date of Purchase and Price paid. vi. Insured&rsquo;s
declared Value of the vehicle. vii. Colour of vehicle and speedometer
reading, average distance traveled &amp; frequency. This indicates usage and
helps in determining wear and tear or over usage based on occupation/
business. viii. Additional fittings, modifications in the vehicle. This
provides information on additional covers that can be offered or
additional risk exposure. c) Details of other vehicles: owned by the
proposer and details of accidents during the past 3 to 5 years. These
details give some idea about the physical and moral hazard. d) Details
of insurance history: This is required to ascertain whether there were
any adverse features, such as decline of risk, cancellation of policy or
imposition of special terms and conditions. e) Questions relating to
extra benefits: for which additional premium is charged and of
information for which discount of premium is granted, such as no claim
discount earned, voluntary excess to be borne, etc. f) Certain other
particulars: in case of commercial vehicles, are required the type of
permit and in the case of passenger vehicles, the total licensed
passenger carrying capacity. It is essential that the proposer should
decide within which class the vehicle falls because the certificate of
insurance is worded accordingly. If it is found that the vehicle is
being used for a purpose not permitted by the certificate, the user is
liable to penalties for contravention under the Motor Vehicles Act. g)
Declaration Clause: The answers to the questions are followed by
declaration which is in the nature of a warranty that the answers are
correct and shall form the basis of contract with the company. The
declaration makes it a contractual Duty of Good Faith.</p>

<hr>
<p>This is a document evidencing that a motor vehicle is insured against third party
liability as required under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. It is an
offence to use a vehicle without a proper Certificate of Insurance
issued by an authorised insurer. The insurance company is under a duty
to inform the Registering Authority that the policy has not followed the
cover note, within 7 days of the expiry of the cover note as required
under section 147 (4). The only exceptions are Government vehicles and
such other vehicles as may be specifically excluded by the Government.

<li>Endorsement</li>

<hr>
<p>An endorsement is a written

incorporates changes in the terms of the policy. An endorsement can be
of two types: a) Premium bearing endorsement: endorsement for which
additional premium is charged.</p>
<p>Example Some of the examples are:  Transfer of ownership  Addition of
LPG/ CNG kit  Change of RTO location</p>
<p>b) Non-premium bearing endorsement; endorsement additional premium is
charged.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Some of the examples are:  Rectification in contact details
Rectification in engine/ chassis number  Addition of hypothecation An
endorsement may be issued at the time of issuing the policy to provide
additional benefits and covers (e.g. Legal Liability to Driver) or to
impose restrictions (e.g. excess accidental damage in a public carrier
policy). The wordings of these endorsements are as per erstwhile Tariff.
An endorsement may also be issued subsequently to record changes such as
change of address, change of name, change of vehicles etc. There are 72
Endorsements carried forward from the erstwhile tariff.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Renewal notice</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>It is the practice of companies to issue Renewal Notice to the
insured usually one month in advance of the date of expiry of the
policy. This notice provides details of renewal premium, including No
Claim discount, if earned. As notice is prepared in advance, there could
be a claim between the date of preparation and the date of expiry. The
renewal premium invited is subject to the provision that in the event of
a claim suitable adjustments will be made in the premium. The insured's
attention is also invited to revise the insured value of the vehicle in
the light of current market values. The insured's attention is also
invited to inform any material change as to use of vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="8e-insurance-to-come-into-existence-from-next-year">8.E-insurance to come into existence from next year</h2>
<p>CAMS Repository Services Ltd has stated that over 25 crore policy holders owning close
to 37 crore policies would get their e-insurance in phased manner. The
Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI) is likely to
announce the roadmap to make it mandatory, by which insurance companies
would have to compulsorily issue policies to their customers only in
electronic form. According to an estimate, the current cost to insurer
to service policies is over Rs. 600 per annum per policy. However, with
insurance repository, the initial incidental cost would come down to
less than Rs. 100 per annum per policy, adding the initiative shall
benefit both policy holders and insurance companies from convenience and
cost front. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>&quot;Insurance policyholders would have the option to access their
insurance policies online by opening an insurance account in the
electronic form, free of cost. The benefits for policyholder holding an
e-insurance are safety, convenience, service on demand, single KYC and
aggregate view of all policies,&quot; he said. Insurance repository system
allows policy holders to keep insurance policies in electronic form and
undertake changes and revision in the policy with speed and accuracy.
Recently, IRDAI permitted five companies to act as repositories for
managing e-policy. These are:     </p>

<p>The introduction of private insurers in India
in 2000 following the passing of the Insurance Regulatory and
Development Authority Act has brought about intense competition in the
market for insurance business. Non-life or general insurance business
too has been exposed to this competition. However the existence of the
Tariffs in Fire, Motor Engineering and Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation muted this
competition to some extent. There has been a cut-throat competition in
the other non-life business and a scramble for the best risks in the
Tariff business. As the restrictions of the Tariff were seen to be a
barrier for differentiation of product and development of new products,
the insurers were demanding scrapping of the tariffs and freedom to
devise policy wordings and determine rates to grow in the market. The
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) has withdrawn the
India Motor Tariff with effect from 1st April 2009. However the wordings
of ‗Liability Only&rsquo; Policy are retained and the rates for ‗Liability
Only&rsquo; policy are regulated by the IRDAI. With regard to ‗Own Damage'
covers the existing policy 82</p>
<p>wordings are to be continued but insurers are given freedom of pricing
and permitted to provide add on covers after obtaining the Regulator&rsquo;s
approval. The erstwhile India Motor Tariff wordings will remain as
Standard cover. The following two policy forms continue to be used: i.
Liability only and ii. Package policy, The Authority has prescribed
proposal forms for third party ‗Liability Only&rsquo; policy for private car,
two wheelers and commercial vehicles. Motor Insurance business in India
was governed by India Motor Tariff since the 1970&rsquo;s subject to
amendments, the last being in July 2002. Although the Tariffs were
discontinued from 1st January 2007, however the policy wordings are
required to be continued until such time that IRDAI permits the change
in policy wordings, terms and conditions. The existing policies are now
termed as standard policies with insurers free to provide add-on covers
as approved by IRDA under the ―File and Use guidelines‖. i. Liability
Only Policy This form covers, ‗Act Liability&rsquo; and ‗Personal Accident
risk to owner/driver&rsquo;. ―Liability Only‖ Policy is called Standard Form
for ‗Liability Only&rsquo; policy. This form applies uniformly to all classes
of vehicles, whether Private Cars, Commercial Vehicles, Motor Cycles or
Motor Scooters, with suitable amendments in ‗Limitations as to Use&rsquo;,
‗Drivers Condition&rsquo; and some special Conditions. ii. Package Policy
Package Policy form provides wider cover for ‗own damage&rsquo;, ‗Act
liability&rsquo; and ‗PA to owner / driver&rsquo;, with suitable modifications based
on the class of vehicle covered. It can also be extended to cover
additional liabilities such as liability to employees of the insured who
may be traveling in or driving the employer&rsquo;s cars, augmented Third
Party Property Damage Liability, etc. Insurers could, restrict the cover
under the Own Damage section of Package Policy without reduction in
premiums or increase the premium. However, ‗Liability only&rsquo; cover cannot
be modified.</p>
<ol>
<li>Own Damage Cover</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>a) Liability to third parties: The
policy covers the insured&rsquo;s legal liability for accidents occurring out
of the use of the vehicle, in a public place, anywhere in India. This
liability is subject to the Limit of Liability as laid down the Policy
and Schedule are as follows:</p>
<p>i. Death or Bodily injury to any person as far as is necessary to meet

<p>i. The owner of an insured vehicle is termed
as ‗owner-driver&rsquo;. The Personal Accident to Owner/Driver cover is
provided to owners of all individually owned vehicles. Vehicles
registered in the name of a Company or organizations do not have
compulsion of this cover. The provision was included in ‗Liability
policy&rsquo;, as it was observed that in most motor accidents, no other
vehicle was involved while the owner, traveling in the vehicle suffering
an injury, was not entitled to compensation. The situation got
accentuated, if the injured owner was not having any insurance to cover
himself. The owner or family thus landed in financial distress. To
mitigate the financial loss faced by the family, this coverage is
provided. ii. The insurer undertakes to pay compensation to the
owner-driver for bodily injury or death in the event of an accident
directly connected with the vehicle or whilst driving or mounting or
dismounting or traveling as a co-driver, caused by accidental, external,
violent and visible means within 6 calendar months of such injury.
Nature of injury Death Loss of two-limbs or sight of two eyes or one
limb and sight of one eye Loss of one limb or sight of one eye Permanent
Total Disablement (PTD)</p>
<p>iii. Provided that the total compensation does not exceed Rs 1,00,000/-
in case of two-wheeler owners and Rs.2,00,000/- in case of other
vehicles. iv. The injury must not be intentional and/or, the person must
not be under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. v. The
owner-driver must be the registered owner of the vehicle insured and
holding a valid and effective driving licence as per Rule 3 of the
Central Motor Vehicle Rules 1989. vi. The Company will also pay all
costs and expenses incurred with its written consent. vii. Any person
driving the vehicle with insured&rsquo;s consent will also be covered as if
insured under the policy. viii. In the event of death of Insured
persons, the legal heirs or personal representatives will be treated as
if insured and nominee is to be provided compensation as per PA Owner
driver Liability policy.</p>

<p>The Insured persons are entitled

employment.) v. Passengers carried by reason of or in pursuance of a
contact of employment are covered. vi. Any liability to passengers
traveling, entering mounting or alighting from the vehicle other than
under the Motor Vehicle Act 1988. Employee traveling as passenger is not
covered. (Note: passengers traveling in public passenger vehicles are
required to be covered under the MV Act 1988. Passengers in private
vehicles are not required to be covered separately.) vii. Losses arising
directly or indirectly due to war and war like perils. However, any
claim for damage, which the insured can prove is independent of such
perils, will be payable. viii. Any liability arising directly or
indirectly from nuclear weapon material.</p>
<h2 id="g-conditions">g) Conditions</h2>

to drive the vehicle. This can be explained with the help of the
following example:</p>
<p>Example Stage Carriage/Contract Carriage/</p>
<p>Any person including Insured:  Provided that the person driving holds
an effective driving licence at the time of the accident and is not
disqualified from holding or obtaining such a licence  Provided also
that the person holding an effective Learner&rsquo;s Licence may also drive
the vehicle when not used for the transport of passengers at the time of
the accident and that such person satisfies the requirements of Rule 3
of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules 1989</p>
<p>x. The schedule incorporates the proposal and declaration. Thereafter
the signature of the authorised insurer appears.</p>

<li>Liability covers under package policies</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>There are variations between the ―Liability only
policies‖ and ―Liability cover provided under the Package policies‖. The
variations are as follows: a) Occupants / pillion rider; loading
unloading of operators i. In the case of private cars and two-wheelers
the death or bodily injury includes occupants/ pillion rider carried in
the vehicle. ii. For commercial vehicles it includes loading/unloading
operators for goods carriage vehicles IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<h2 id="b-wider-property-damage-liability-cover">b) Wider property damage liability cover</h2>
<p>In the case of Property damage
cover, wider liability is being provided. i. The limits specified for
Motorised two-wheelers Rs. 100000/ii. All other vehicles Rs. 750000/The
limit of Rs. 6000/- is applied when the insured opts out of wider Third
Party Property Damage (TPPD) cover (a discount in premium is allowed).</p>
<h2 id="c-wider-property-damage-belonging-to-others">c) Wider property damage belonging to others</h2>
<p>The policy does not cover
property held in trust or in control of the insured. This implies that
property belonging to others, lying with insured is not covered.</p>
<h2 id="d-place-where-liability-arise">d) Place where liability arise</h2>
<p>i. The cover for liability is not restricted
to ―Public Place‖ for private cars and two wheelers used for personal
use. In the ―liability only ―policy this restriction applies. ii. For
commercial vehicles liability is restricted to public place, not beyond
limits of any carriageway or thoroughfare for loading/unloading. iii. In
the case of commercial vehicles damage to bridge, viaduct road, or
anything beneath by vibration or weight of the vehicle or load carried
is not covered.</p>
<h2 id="e-towing-of-disabled-vehicles">e) Towing of disabled vehicles</h2>
<p>Commercial vehicles policy permits this service provided it is not done for hire or reward.
The policy will pay for liability arising out of such towing service.</p>
<h2 id="f-limitations-as-to-use-for-commercial-vehicles">f) Limitations as to use for commercial vehicles</h2>
<p>i. For Goods Carrying
Vehicle: Use only for carriage of goods within the meaning of the MV Act
1988.</p>
<h2 id="g-the-policy-does-not-cover">g) The policy does not cover</h2>
<p>i. Use for organised racing, pace
making, reliability trial or speed testing. ii. Use whilst drawing a
trailer except the towing (other than for reward) of any one disabled
mechanically propelled vehicle.</p>
<p>iii. Use for carrying passengers in the vehicle except employees(other
than driver) not exceeding six in number coming under the purview of EC
Act 1923. iv. For Passenger carrying vehicle: Use only for carriage of
passengers in accordance with the permits (Contract or Stage carriage)
issued within the meaning of the MV Act 1988. (a) Use for organised
racing, pace making, reliability trial or speed testing (b) Use whilst
drawing a trailer except the towing (other than for reward) of any one
disabled mechanically propelled vehicle h) Additional covers The
‗Liability only policy&rsquo; can be extended to cover additional risks. These
may be optional or essential. Inclusion of each of these covers involves
incorporating an endorsement to the policy. i. Essential cover (a)
Passenger Liability in Public Passenger service Vehicles: This is an
essential cover for all passenger vehicles i.e. taxi, buses, and
rickshaws subject to additional premium. (b) Bi-fuel vehicles: This is
also an essential cover for vehicles fitted with bi-fuel arrangement
i.e., in addition to Petrol or Diesel they have attachments for CNG or
LPG as fuel for running the vehicle, are subject to increased hazard in
the event of accident. Such vehicles require an endorsement in the
Registration Certificate by the RTA. In such cases an additional premium
is to be charged for Third Party liability cover. (c) Liability for
persons employed in connection with the operation of the vehicle: The MV
Act 1988 provides for liability to employees connected with the
operations of the vehicle i.e. driver, conductor, employees engaged in
loading/unloading operations in goods vehicle. Liability for these
employees arise under the Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act 1923 is also an
essential cover. This liability is covered by charging an additional
premium. ii. Non-essential covers (a) Personal accident covers for
un-named passenger: The policy can be extended to cover PA benefits to
passengers in the vehicle. The benefits are similar to that provided for
the owner/driver. However the Sum Insured can be selected by the insured
and ranges between Rs. 10000/to 200000/- per passenger. The premium on
the Sum Insured selected is IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>to be charged on the basis of the authorised passenger carrying capacity
of the vehicle. (b) Liability for non-fare paying passengers: Employees
other than those connected with the operations of the vehicle are not
entitled to compensation under the MV Act 1988. Their liability would
arise under the Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act 1923, or if not an employee/
workmen under Common Law. Non-fare paying passengers can be covered only
when the permit of the vehicle allows such carrying or the MV Act 1988
permits.</p>
<p>Example Under Section 147 of the Act 1988, it is necessary to
compulsorily cover Owner of Goods being carried in goods carrying
vehicle.</p>
<p>Test Yourself 3 In the event of the death of insured, the policy will
remain valid for from the death or until expiry of the policy (whichever
happens earlier). I. Three months II. Six months III. Seven months IV.
Nine months</p>
<p>D. Coverage for motor policies 1. Coverage for Private Car Package
Policy: There are minor variations in the coverage for Own Damage for
Private cars and Two-wheelers under the Package Policy. The variations
are being clarified as we go along. Section I &ndash; Own Damage a) Risks
covered The Company will ‗indemnify&rsquo; the Insured against loss i. Fire,
explosion, self-ignition or lightening; (Note: As regards ―explosion‖
peril, both external and internal explosions are deemed to be covered.)
ii. Burglary, housebreaking or theft; iii. Riot and strike; iv.
Earthquake (fire and shock damage);</p>
<p>v. Flood, typhoon, hurricane, storm, tempest, inundation, cyclone,
hailstorm, frost; vi. Accidental external means; vii. Malicious act;
viii. Terrorist activity; ix. Landslide / rockslide. x. Whilst in
transit by road, rail, inland waterway, lift, elevator or air; b)
Contract to indemnify The contract is not to ―pay‖ the loss to the
insured, but to ―indemnify‖ him against his loss. Thus if parts are
damaged in an accident and are replaced with new parts, the new price
will not be paid, rather the new cost will be depreciated for age of the
vehicle i.e., new cost reduced by actual depreciation; and the balance
will be payable. c) Loss or damage of accessories It is covered only if
the accessories are on the Motor car.</p>
<p>Example If the accessories are detached and kept separately in a garage
and are destroyed as a result of any peril mentioned above e.g., fire to
the garage, they will not be covered by the Motor policy. The term
―accessories‖ do not apply to the engine of a car, for it is an
essential part of the vehicle. i. Loss or damage to accessories in the
case of two-wheelers, theft of accessories is not covered unless the
vehicle is also stolen at the same time. This can be covered as an
add-on risk by charging additional premium. There is no satisfactory
definition of the word ―accessory‖.</p>
<p>Definition The word ―accessory‖, means generally those parts which are
directly supplied by the manufacturer along with the car, but which are
not essential for the running of the motor car, are considered as
accessories. It should be noted that music systems, air-conditioners and
other electric or electronic items, etc. fitted nowadays by the motor
car owners on their Cars, will not be considered as accessories, but
they will be considered as extra fittings and will not be covered unless
they are separately described and valued in the Schedule of the Policy.</p>
<p>ii. Extra fittings: which are standard and provided as inclusive with
the vehicle by the manufacturer need not be separately described and are
deemed to be included in the value proposed for insurance. For example:
a DX or LX model vehicle has built-in extra fitting like Air
conditioner, Music system or Power steering/windows. These are part of
the Manufacturers selling price and included in IDV. In this case the
standard premium rate is charged and no extra-fitting premium rate is
chargeable separately. d) Deduction for depreciation Depreciation is
deducted for parts replaced following an accident as follows: For all
rubber/nylon/plastic parts, tyres and tubes, batteries and airbags For
all fiberglass components</p>
<p>50% 30%</p>
<p>For all parts made of glass</p>
<p>Nil</p>
<p>For all other parts as a percentage based on the age of the vehicle as
follows: % of Age of vehicle depreciation Not exceeding 6 months Nil
Between 6 months and 1 year</p>
<p>5%</p>
<p>Between 1 year and 2 years</p>
<p>10%</p>
<p>Between 2 years and 3 years</p>
<p>15%</p>
<p>Between 3 years and 4 years</p>
<p>25%</p>
<p>Between 4 years and 5 years</p>
<p>35%</p>
<p>Between 5 and 10 years</p>
<p>40%</p>
<p>Over 10 years</p>
<p>50%</p>
<p>e) Exclusions under &ldquo;own damage&rdquo; section The insurer will not be liable
to make any payment for: i. Consequential loss, Depreciation, Wear and
Tear, Mechanical or Electrical Breakdown, Failures and Breakage; and ii.
Damage to tyres unless the motor car is damaged at the same time when
the liability of the insurer is limited to 50% of the cost of
replacement; iii. Any accidental loss or damage suffered whilst the
insured or any person driving with the knowledge and consent of the
insured is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. 94</p>
<p>f) Consequential loss The policy covers only direct loss caused by an
accident to the car. The insured may suffer loss of use of the car
during repairs, in the form of cost and expenses of alternate
transportation. This is a consequential loss, which is not covered. g)
Depreciation, wear and tear These losses are not in the nature of
accidental fortuitous events. In course of time, motor vehicle, like any
other property, suffers wear and tear due to use. Since wear and tear is
inevitable, it cannot be insured. The word ―depreciation‖ used in the
exclusion which claimant is expected to bear, isin terms of the
principle of indemnity. In the latter case, the policy clearly indicates
the rates of depreciation to be applied in respect of parts replaced. i.
Depreciation caused due to accident: However, when vehicle meets with a
serious accident and is repaired to be placed in a satisfactory manner,
even so it may have depreciated in value as a result of the accident, in
the sense that, if it is offered for sale, the owner may realise lesser
value than what it would have fetched prior to the accident. This kind
of depreciation is excluded by the policy even though directly caused by
the accident. ii. Mechanical or electrical breakdown, failures, and
breakages: Mechanical breakdown is associated with wear and tear; as
such a breakdown is caused by metal fatigue. However, subsequent damage
following mechanical breakdown is covered by the policy. If the steering
rod breaks and causes an accident resulting in damage to the car, claim
in respect of breakage in steering is not payable, but subsequent or
consequential damage to the car is accidental and claim in respect of
that will be admissible. h) Protection and removal costs If the motor
car is disabled by reason of loss or damage covered under the policy,
the insurer will bear reasonable cost of protection and removal to the
nearest repairers and of redelivery to the insured but not exceeding in
all Rs. 1,500/- in respect of any accident. i) Authorisation for repair
The insured may authorise repairs necessitated by damage covered under
the policy, provided that: i. The estimated cost of such repairs does
not exceed Rs. 500/-.</p>
<p>ii. The insurer is furnished forthwith a detailed estimate of the cost,
and iii. The insured gives the insurer full assistance to see that such
repair is necessary and the charge reasonable. j) Sum insured -
Insured‟s Declared Value (IDV) The IDV is deemed to be the Sum Insured
for the purpose of the policy and is fixed at the commencement of each
policy period for the insured vehicle. The IDV is generally treated as
the Market Value throughout the policy period without further
depreciation for Total (TL) or Constructive Total Loss (CTL) claims. CTL
is understood as when the repair &amp; retrieval cost of the vehicle as
permitted under the policy exceeds 75% of the IDV. The IDV is usually
fixed on the basis of the manufacturers&rsquo; listed selling price of the
brand &amp; model and is adjusted for depreciation (as per schedule below)
Age of the vehicle Not exceeding 6 months</p>
<p>% of depreciation 5%</p>
<p>Between 6 months and 1 year</p>
<p>15%</p>
<p>Between 1 year and 2 years</p>
<p>20%</p>
<p>Between 2 years and 3 years</p>
<p>30%</p>
<p>Between 3 years and 4 years</p>
<p>40%</p>
<p>Between 4 years and 5 years</p>
<p>50%</p>
<p>Example Maruti Swift 2007 Model to be renewed in 2011, Manufacturers
selling price for new Swift in 2011 is Rs. 550000/-. IDV for 2007 model
will be 50% of 550000 = 275000/- with depreciation 50% (4 to 5 yrs). IDV
for vehicles over 5 years and obsolete vehicles is to be determined on
the basis of an understanding between the insurers and insured. 2.
Coverage for Two Wheeler The coverage for a two wheeler is similar but
with the following amendments. i. The two wheeler policy covers theft of
accessories only if the vehicle is stolen at the same time. ii.
Protection &amp; removal costs to the extent of Rs. 300/- only iii.
Authorisation for repairs restricted to Rs. 150/-. 96</p>
<p>Section II - Liability to Third Parties: This has been dealt with
Liability To Third Parties supra. It is to be noted that the coverage
under the Package policy is wider as discussed under liability cover
under package policies. a) General exceptions (application to all
Sections of the policy). The Insurer shall not be liable in respect of:
i. Any accident, loss, damage or liability caused, sustained or incurred
outside the Geographical Area (described in the Schedule of the Policy).
ii. Any claim out of any contractual liability. It will be appreciated
that the policy covers only legal liability; therefore, no other
liability assumed by the insured under any agreement or contract is
covered. Whilst the insured vehicle is: (a) Being used otherwise than in
accordance with the ‗limitations as to Use&rsquo;. The Schedule of the Policy
describes these ‗Limitations as to Use&rsquo;. (b) Being driven by any person
other than a Driver as stated in the Driver's Clause. The Clause is
described in the Schedule of the Policy. iii. Nuclear risks exclusion
clause: loss, damage, liability arising from ionizing radiations or
nuclear waste process of nuclear fission. iv. Any accident loss, damage
or liability directly or indirectly, proximately or remotely arising
from War, and kindred peril. The burden of proving that loss, damage or
liability arose independently of the said occurrences shall be on the
Insured. Unless this burden is satisfactorily discharged, there is no
liability on the Insurer to pay such claims. v. Deductible Franchise
(also known as excess): The Company shall not be liable for each and
every claim under Section 1 (loss or damage to the insured vehicle) of
the policy in respect of deductible as stated in the policy schedule. b)
Conditions of the policy: The policy contains a number of conditions
which are expressly stated to be conditions precedent to liability of
the insurers.</p>
<h2 id="i-notice-of-loss">i. Notice of Loss</h2>
<p>Notice should be given immediately to the insurer
upon the occurrence of any accident, loss or damage and, in the event of
any claim the insured should give all information and assistance as the
insurer may require. Every letter, claim, writ, summons, etc. should be
forwarded to the insurer immediately on the receipt of insured. In the
event of any impending prosecution, inquest or fatal inquiry, the
insured should immediately inform the insurer in writing. In case of
theft or other criminal act, which may be the subject of a claim, the
insured should give immediate notice to the Police and cooperate with
the insurer in securing the conviction of the offender</p>
<h2 id="ii-no-admission-offer-promise-or-payment">ii. No, Admission, Offer, Promise or Payment</h2>
<p>The insured should not settle or
make any payment in respect of any claim, or admit liability or make any
other admission with respect to the accident or any claim arising there
from, without the written consent of the insurer. The insurer shall be
entitled, if he so desires, to take over and conduct in the name of the
insured , the defence or settlement of any claim or to prosecute in the
name of the insured any claim for indemnity. The insured should give any
information or assistance which the insurer may require for the purpose
of resisting or settling any claim.</p>
<h2 id="iii-safeguarding-the-vehicle-from-loss-or-damage">iii. Safeguarding The Vehicle From Loss Or Damage</h2>
<p>The insured is expected to take all reasonable steps to
safeguard the motor car from loss or damage. He is also obliged to
maintain it in an efficient condition. In the event of any accident or
breakdown the motor car should not be left unattended without proper
precaution being taken to prevent further damage or loss. If the motor
car is driven before necessary repairs are affected, any extension of
the damage or any further damage shall be entirely at insured's own
risk.</p>
<h2 id="iv-cancellation">iv. Cancellation</h2>
<p>The insurer may cancel the policy by sending seven
days notice by recorded delivery to the insured, and in such event he
will return to the insured the premium paid less the pro rata portion
thereon for the period the policy has been in force. The policy may be
cancelled by the insured on seven days notice and provided no claim has
arisen during the currency of the policy, the insured shall be entitled
to a return of premium, less premium at the insurance company's Short
Period Rates for the period the policy has been in force. However where
the ownership of the vehicle is transferred, the policy cannot be
cancelled, unless evidence that the vehicle is insured elsewhere is
produced.</p>
<h2 id="v-contribution">v. Contribution</h2>
<p>If at the time any claim arises, there is any
other existing insurance covering the same loss, damage or liability,
then the insurer shall not be liable to pay or contribute more than its
ratable proportion of such loss, damage, compensation, costs or
expenses.</p>
<h2 id="vi-arbitration">vi. Arbitration</h2>
<p>This condition provides for settlement of
disputes under the policy through arbitration which is a less expensive
and faster method of settlement than litigation. Only disputes regarding
the amount or quantum of the claim can be referred to arbitration. If
the insurer has disputed or denied liability under the policy, then the
insured will have to take recourse to a court of law. The arbitrator has
to be appointed in writing by the parties in difference. If the parties
cannot agree upon a single arbitrator, then two disinterested persons
are to be appointed as arbitrators, of whom one shall be appointed in
writing by each of the parties. If either party shall refuse or fail to
appoint an arbitrator within two calendar months after receipts of
notice in writing by the other party in accordance with the provisions
of the Arbitration Act,1996 then the other party shall be at liberty to
appoint a sole arbitrator. In case of disagreement between the
arbitrators, the difference will have to be referred to the decision of
an Umpire, who has to be appointed by the arbitrators in writing before
entering on the reference. The Umpire has to sit with the arbitrators
and preside at the meetings.</p>
<p>It shall be a condition precedent to any right of action or suit upon
the policy that award by such arbitrators or Umpire of the amount of the
loss or damage shall be first obtained. A claim will be deemed to be
abandoned or time-barred if a suit is not filed in a court of law within
12 calendar months from the date the insurer declines liability for the
claim. Thus this condition stipulates a time limit for filing suit.
Note: There is no bar on the claimant filing a case in Consumer Court
due to this condition. However, it must be ensured that such a case is
filed within two years of the accident. Similarly if the policy is taken
in the individual name, the claimant can have recourse to Insurance
Ombudsman after 30 days of filing complaint with insurance companies
Grievance Redressal Cell. However, time limit for filing application
with Insurance Ombudsman is one year.</p>
<h2 id="vii-observance-of-conditions-as-precedent-to-liability">vii. Observance of Conditions as precedent to liability</h2>
<p>This last condition stipulates that due
observance and fulfillment of the terms, conditions and endorsements of
the policy and the truth of the statements and answers in the proposal
form shall be conditions precedent to any liability of the insurer under
the insurance.</p>
<h2 id="c-the-schedule-of-the-policy">c) The schedule of the policy</h2>
<p>The Conditions are preceded
by a clause which states that the Policy and the Schedule shall be read
together and any word or expression to which a specific meaning has been
attached in any part of the Policy or of the Schedule, shall bear the
same meaning wherever it may appear. The purpose and the effect of this
clause is to link the Schedule to the policy. Salient information in the
Schedule i. Policy Number, name and address of the insured, his business
or profession. ii. Geographical Area. iii. Details of the insured car
viz.: Registration mark - number, make of vehicle, type of body, cubic
capacity, year of manufacture, seating capacity including driver,
insured estimate of value (i.e. IDV) Chassis and Engine numbers.</p>
<p>iv. Limitations as to use: - Use only for social, domestic and pleasure
purpose and for the insured's business. The Policy does not cover use
for hire and reward or for organised racing and pace, making,
reliability trials and speed testing, the carriage of goods (other than
samples) in connection with any trade or business or use for any purpose
in connection with the Motor Trade. v. Driver's clause: Driver: Any
person including insured. Provided that the person driving is holding an
effective driving licence at the time of the accident and is not
disqualified from holding or obtaining such a licence. Provided also
that the person holding an effective learner's licence may also drive
the vehicle and such a person satisfies the requirements of Rule 3 of
the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989.</p>
<h2 id="definition-2">Definition</h2>
<p>The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 defines &quot;driving licence&quot; as
the licence issued by a competent authority as defined in Chapter II of
the Act, authorising the person specified therein to drive, otherwise
than as a learner, a motor vehicle or a motor vehicle of any specified
class or description. Limits of Indemnity Under Section II -1 (i) Under
Section II- 1(ii)</p>
<p>As per Motor Vehicles Act 1988 Rs.750000/- in respect of any one claim
or series of claims arising out of one event.</p>
<p>Note: Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides for unlimited liability for
third party death or bodily injury claims. The amount awarded becomes
payable without limit.</p>
<h2 id="vi-bonus-clause">vi. Bonus Clause</h2>
<p>The policy provides for a ‗No
claim discount&rsquo; for each claim free year, on the own damage section of
the premium of the policy. The discount starts at 20% rising to 50% over
5 years. The discount is available within a period of 90 days from the
expiry of the policy. 3. Coverage for Commercial Vehicles All vehicles
plying for hire or reward are termed Commercial Vehicles. Indian
Insurers continue to follow the classification of vehicles under this
category as laid down in the erstwhile tariff. The policy wordings and
parameters for rating are also continued to be followed with amendments
as individually incorporated by insurers through ―File and Use‖
procedures.</p>
<p>The reluctance of private insurers to underwrite Commercial Vehicle
insurance due to the high claim ratios in Third Party insurance and the
need to discontinue tariffs in all classes of insurance drew the
Regulator&rsquo;s attention to this aspect of motor insurance. Accordingly, to
ensure that insurers did not price Motor TP premium to unreasonable
levels, IRDA issued notification ensuring that TP premium rates would
continue to be regulated and also announced creation of a Motor Third
Party Declined Risk Pool for sharing of Third party claims by all
insurers. Scope of standard form for commercial vehicles package policy
Section 1 - Loss or damage: The perils covered are identical, subject to
the following additional exclusions: i. Loss or damage caused by
overloading or strain of the motor vehicle, and loss or damage to
accessories by burglary, housebreaking or theft unless the motor vehicle
is stolen at the same time ii. Loss or damage to tyres tubes mudguards;
lamps bonnet side parts painting of damaged portion. (This exclusion can
be covered as an addon). The protection and removal cost values differ
for the category of vehicle involved Section II - Liability to third
parties: As per ‗Liability only policy&rsquo; liability to third parties for
bodily injury &amp;/or death, Property damage and Personal accident cover
for owner driver with additional cover for passenger liability, wider
legal liability of Driver/ Cleaner and Labourers, Owner of goods or his
representative whilst carried in goods carriage. Section III - Towing
disabled vehicles: The policy permits towing of a disabled vehicle and
covers both liability and damage in the process of towing. However, the
towing should not be carried out for hire or reward. It will also not
cover damage to the towed vehicle or property carried on it. Section
IV - Personal accident cover for owner/driver: This is similar to the
coverage mentioned above: a) Personal accident to owner/driver:
Avoidance of Certain Terms and Rights of Recovery: The clause is
identical to the Private car Package policy b) General exceptions: All
the six exceptions are similar to Private Car package policy</p>
<p>c) Deductible (excess): The OD section is subject to deductible for
each and every claim. The amount of deductible differs based on category
and class of vehicle. d) Conditions: The conditions of the policy are
similar to the Private car Package policy. Condition 3, however,
provides that if a valid claim for TPPD arises the insurer will pay up
to their maximum liability and relinquish conduct defence or settlement
of the case. The insured then has to manage defence and conduct for the
balance liability and costs. i. Carrying Hazardous Chemicals: The
commercial Vehicle policy provides for strict compliance to Motor
Vehicle Rules for vehicles carrying hazardous chemicals. (Refer Annexure
I) (a) Rule 129-A (Spark arrestor) Goods carrying Vehicles transporting
dangerous or hazardous goods are required to be fitted with a spark
arrestor. (b) Rule 131 to 133 places responsibility on consignor,
transporter and driver carrying such hazardous or dangerous substances
to take all precautions and comply with all safety aspects during
transportation. The steps include full information about the nature of
the goods being carried, holding a Public Liability Act policy. Drivers
Licence to be endorsement for Hazardous goods transportation. The
schedule is similar to the Private Car except for the (a) Limitation as
to Use clause- refer to Liability Chapter (b) Driver clause &ndash; as per
Liability only Schedule The above policy terms apply to Commercial
vehicles for the carriage of Goods / Passengers, Trailers, Miscellaneous
Class of Vehicles etc. e) Extensions: The OD sections of the motor
policies can be extended to cover a number of benefits and also coverage
for some exclusion under the policy: i. Additional electronic or
electrical fittings: Fittings installed in the vehicle by the insured
can be covered by express description and Value. Premium will be charged
additional ii. Installation of CNG/LPG Kit: can be covered on payment of
additional premium. iii. Fibre glass fuel tanks: The trend to lighter
vehicles means that such components are being installed in motor
vehicles. The cost is substantial and hence can be covered under the
policy on additional premium.</p>
<p>iv. Extension to cover burglary and theft of accessories for
twowheelers: This extension can be provided by deleting the exclusion
under the policy. For commercial vehicles loss or damage to tyres tubes
lamps mudguards etc which is exclusion can be covered with additional
premium. However expenses for these items will be subject to a 50%
excess. Thus if these cost are around Rs. 32,000 only Rs. 16,000 will be
payable.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-4">Test Yourself 4</h2>
<p>If the motor car is disabled by reason of loss or damage
covered under the policy, the insurer will bear reasonable cost of
protection and removal to the nearest repairers and of redelivery to the
insured but not exceeding in all in respect of any accident. I. Rs.
1,000/II. Rs. 2,500/III. Rs. 1,500/IV. Rs. 5,000/-</p>
<h2 id="e-motor-trade-policies">E. Motor trade policies</h2>
<ol>
<li>Motor trade policies</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Policies are available
to cater to the special requirements of Motor Trade. These policies are
taken by a Motor Trader who may be either a dealer or distributor of
brand new vehicles or secondhand vehicles or he may be engaged in their
overhaul or repair. In the course of his business, he will have to
demonstrate the vehicles to his prospective clients by giving a trial
run. To enable him to do so, the transport authorities allow him number
plates which are known as Trade Certificates which he can temporarily
attach to the vehicle being taken out on the public road for trial runs.
Alternatively, these plates are allotted the names of the drivers who
will be demonstrating the vehicles. Normally, Trade Certificates are
used in case of brand new vehicles which are unregistered and named
driver plates are used for driving secondhand registered vehicles. The
Motor Trade will handle a variety of vehicles which will be constantly
changing. These vehicles are his stock-in-trade and therefore he has
full insurable interest, either as owner or bailey. A Motor Trader is
also exposed to legal liability for accidental bodily injury, fatal or
otherwise, and/or damage to property of third parties, caused by: 
Negligence in connection with the use of the vehicles, and/or  Defects
in the plant or premises of the Motor Trader. 104</p>

'B' Policy, and  Standard Form of Motor Trade Internal Risks Policy</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Standard Form of Motor Trade 'B' Policy</li>

motor vehicle is:  In public place, or  Temporarily garaged during the
course of a journey elsewhere than in or on any premises owned by or in
the occupation of the insured. Section I - Loss or Damage: Risks Covered
and Exclusions These are identical to those covered under the Commercial
Vehicle ‗Package Policy&rsquo;. a) Deduction for depreciation: The deduction
percentages are identical to those applying to Private Package Policy.
b) Costs of Protection and Removal: The insurer will bear such costs up
to Rs. 150/- any one accident. c) Depreciation for Arriving at IDV: The
Deduction percentages are identical to those applying to Private Car
Package Policy. The clause allowing the insured to authorise minor
repairs up to certain limits does not appear in this policy. Section
II - Liability to Third Party a) This Section provides similar cover as
under Commercial Vehicles 'B' Policy. Also, the exclusions (a) to (e)
are identical to those in the Commercial Vehicles 'B' Policy.
Exclusion (f) found in the latter policy is absent from the Motor Trade
'B' Policy. b) The insurer will pay all costs and expenses incurred
with its written consent. c) The insurer will indemnify any Driver,
provided that such Driver: i. Is not entitled to indemnity under any
other policy, ii. Shall, as though he were the insured, observe, fulfill
and be subject to the terms, exceptions and conditions of the policy.</p>
<p>Provisions 4 and 5, i.e. provisions relating to representation at any
inquest etc. and indemnifying legal representative are identical to
those in the Commercial Vehicles 'B' Policy. Section III &ndash; Trailers
The indemnity provided by Section I (Own Damage) and Section II
(Liability to Third Party) is extended to any vehicle (Mechanically
propelled or otherwise) attached to the Motor Vehicle for the purpose of
being towed. This extension is subject to the following provisions: i.
The Limits of Liability shown in the Schedule of the Policy are not
increased by this extension; ii. The insurer shall not be liable in
respect of damage to property conveyed by the towed vehicle; iii. There
is no liability in respect of loss, damage and/or liability sustained or
incurred whilst the motor vehicle is towing a greater number of vehicles
than is permitted by law. Note the difference: This Section differs from
Section III of Commercial Vehicles 'B' Policy, which deals with
&quot;Towing Disabled Vehicles&quot;. a) Avoidance of certain terms and right of
recovery This is the usual Clause that appears in all other policies. It
was explained in detail when we were considering the scope of Private
Car 'Package' Policy. b) Application of limits of indemnity In the
event of any accident involving indemnity to more than one person, any
limitation of the amount of indemnity shall apply to the aggregate
amount of indemnity to all persons indemnified and such indemnity shall
apply in priority to the insured. c) General exceptions applicable to
all sections of the policy All the six General Exceptions are the same
as in the Commercial Vehicles 'Package' Policy. The exclusion
regarding &quot;influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs&quot; appears in the
last extension together with the exclusion of War and allied perils. d)
Deductible Insurer is not liable for each and every claim under
Section-1 (Loss of or damaged to the vehicle insured of this policy in
respect of the deductible stated in the schedule) 106</p>
<p>e) Conditions of the policy The conditions are the same as under
Commercial Vehicles 'Package' Policy. However, with the introduction
of Insured&rsquo;s Declared Value, the said conditions have become identical
for both Commercial Vehicle Package Policy as well as Motor Trade
Policy. f) All trade certificate or all named drivers must be declared
for insurance. The Tariff does not permit giving subsequent Trade
Certificates or Named Drivers a different type of cover from that issued
in connection with the first Trade Certificate or Named Driver. g) The
schedule of the policy The insured motor vehicle is described as any
motor vehicle, property of the insured or in his custody or control
bearing a particular Trade Certificate number. All steam-driven vehicles
are excluded. Limits of liability are stated separately for: i. Own
Damage ii. Death or bodily injury of third parties, which is unlimited
as per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 iii. Third Party Property Damage.
The Motor Vehicles Act limits it to Rs. 6,000/- per accident or event.
Higher limits up to Rs. 750000/- are available at additional premium.
iv. The insured &quot;Motor vehicle&quot; is categorised under: (a) Named Driver
basis, and/or (b) Trade Certificate basis. h) Limitation as to use Use
only for motor trade purposes: The policy does not cover use for hire or
reward or for organised racing, pace-making, reliability trials or speed
testing. i) Driver Any of the following: Any person including insured -
Provided that the person driving is holding an effective driving licence
at the time of the accident and is not disqualified from holding or
obtaining such licence, Provided also that the person holding an
effective learner's licence may also drive the vehicle and such a
person satisfies the requirements of Rule 3 of the Central Motor
Vehicles Rules, 1989</p>
<h2 id="j-no-claim-discount">j) No claim discount</h2>

</ol>
<hr>
<p>In contrast to the Motor Trade Road Risks Policy
(which offers cover in respect of vehicle in a public place but not in
or on the premises of the Insured or in his occupation), this policy
applies to accident, loss or damage or liability arising out of an event
occurring only on the Insured's business premises. This insurance has
not become popular in India owing to the fact that motor repairers,
garage owners and dealers have relied on the disclaimer clause which is
inserted by them in the agreement whilst accepting customers' vehicles
for repairs, etc. Though, they remain exposed to common law liability
which cannot be avoided with inclusion of disclaimer clause. Section I
&ndash; Damage: Subject to the Limit of Liability shown in the Schedule of
Policy, the indemnity under this Section in respect of damage to any
motor vehicle, including its accessories, whilst thereon: i. The
property of the insured or any member of the insured's family or
household, ii. Caused by accidental external and visible means, and iii.
Occurring in or on the premises - that is, insured premises mentioned in
the policy, iv. Insurer reserves the option to repair, reinstate or
replace the vehicle or any of its parts or its accessories or to pay in
cash the amount of the damage. Exceptions of the own-damage Section: The
Insurer shall not be liable to pay: i. For loss of use, depreciation,
wear and tear, mechanical or electrical breakdowns, failures or
breakages, ii. For damage to tyres by application of breaks or by
puncture, cuts or bursts.</p>
<p>a) Excess: Section I - damage to own vehicles - is subject to an
&quot;excess&quot; of Rs. 50/- for two wheelers and Rs. 500/- for others any one
accident or a number of accidents arising out of one cause. b) Limit of
liability for own damage: The Tariff provides for a limit of Rs.
50,000/- any one accident. Section II - Liability to the Public Risks:
This Section indemnifies the Insured against all sums, including
claimant&rsquo;s costs and expenses, which the Insured shall become legally
liable to pay in respect of: a) Accidental death or bodily injury to any
person other than a person in the Insured's service or a member of the
Insured's family or household; b) Accidental damage to: i. Any motor
vehicle (including its accessories whilst thereon) held in trust by or
in the custody or control of the Insured; ii. Other property not being
property belonging to or held in trust by or in the custody or control
of the Insured; occurring, in on or about the premises through: (a) The
negligence of the Insured or any person in the service of or acting on
behalf of the Insured, or (b) By or through any defect in the premises
or in the ways, works, machinery or plant therein. The Insurer will pay
all costs and expenses incurred with his written consent. In the event
of the death of the Insured, the indemnity is available to his legal
personal representatives. c) Limits of liability Under Section II (1) in
respect of any one claim or number of claims arising out of one cause.
.&hellip;.As per Motor vehicles Act, 1988 is unlimited. Under Section II (2)
in respect of any one claim or number of claims arising out of one
cause.&hellip; Rs.6, 000. The Tariff however provides for following higher
limits: i. Property damage excluding damage to vehicles.&hellip;. Rs. 1,
50,000/- any one accident. ii. Damage to vehicles property damage.&hellip;
Rs. 1, 50,000/- any one accident. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>The policy bears certain similarities with Motor package policy and
general public liability policy. (a) Firstly, the policy covers
accidental damage to the insured's own vehicles under the own damage
section. This cover applies only when the vehicle is on the premises. If
the vehicle is on the road, then the Motor Trader's road Risk Policy
will be applicable. (b) Secondly, the policy covers insured's legal
liability for death of or bodily injury to third parties or damage to
their properties due to negligence. This is similar to the cover
provided by general public liability for accidental damage to vehicles,
which are entrusted to him, say, for repairs, due to negligence. Here
the insured is a bailey and hence liable for accidental damage to
vehicles through his own or his employee's negligence. d) General
exceptions (applicable to both the Sections) The Insurer shall not be
liable in respect of: i. Accident, loss, damage or liability due to: 
War and allied perils  Flood, volcanic eruption, earthquake and other
convulsions of nature ii. Damage to property caused directly; or
indirectly by fire or explosion. iii. Any consequence of burglary,
housebreaking or theft or any attempt thereat (such a risk can be
covered under a separate Burglary Policy) iv. Damage to property
sustained while it is being worked upon and directly resulting from such
work, v. Any defective workmanship, vi. Death, injury or damage caused
by or through any demolition or of structural alteration or addition to
the premises or by or through the installation of any equipment. vii.
Death, injury or damage caused by or through or in connection with the
use by the insured of power driven cranes, elevators, lifts or hoists
other than car hoists having a lift not exceeding six feet or its
equivalent, viii. Any liability which attached by virtue of n agreement
but which would not have attached in the absence of such agreement,</p>
<p>ix. Death, injury or damage resulting from the driving elsewhere than
in or on the premises of any vehicle by the Insured or any person in the
service of or acting on behalf of the Insured, x. Damage to any motor
vehicle or its accessories caused by weather conditions. xi. Any
accident, loss, damage to any property or any loss or expenses resulting
or arising there from or consequential loss. xii. Any liability caused,
contributed, arising from radiations contamination by radioactivity
nuclear fuel or nuclear waste.</p>
<h2 id="e-deductible">e) Deductible</h2>
<p>Insurers are not liable under Section - I of this policy
in respect of the deductible stated in the Schedule in respect of each
and every claim.</p>
<h2 id="f-conditions-of-the-policy">f) Conditions of the policy</h2>
<p>i. The Policy and the
Schedule shall be read together as one contract. ii. Every notice or
communication shall be delivered in writing to the Insurer. iii. Notice
of claims: This should be given as soon as possible to the Insurer with
full particulars, Every letter, claim, writ, summons and process should
be notified to the Insurer immediately on receipt. Any impending
prosecution, inquest of fatal injury should also be notified immediately
to the Insurer. iv. No admission, offered, promise or payment shall be
made by the Insured without the consent of the Insurer. The insurer is
entitled if he so desire, to take over and conduct in the name of the
Insured the defence or the settlement of any claim and he shall have
full discretion in the conduct of any proceedings and in the settlement
of any claim the Insured is obliged to give all such a information and
the assistance as the insurer may require. v. The Insured shall exercise
care in the selection of competent employees and shall take all
reasonable steps to safeguard from damage the insured property and
maintain the premises in good repair. The insurer shall have full access
at all reasonable times to the premises and to examine by their
authorised representative any vehicle insured under the Policy.</p>
<h2 id="g-premium">g) Premium</h2>
<p>For Motor Trade Internal Risks Insurance, rates of premium
are based on: i. Superficial area of premises, that is, land and
buildings occupied by the insured for the purpose of motor trade
business. Different are provided for areas ranging from 200 sq. m. to
2000 sq. m. with an additional premium of 1,000 sq. m. or part thereof
in excess of 2000 sq. m. ii. Wages: A percentages premium on the wages
paid to employees subject to adjustment at expiry of the policy. For
this purpose, Condition no. 6 of the Policy is relevant, briefly, it
states: i. The first and all renewable premiums are to be regulated
partly upon the amount of wages, salaries and other earnings paid by the
insured to employees during each period of insurance. ii. The name of
every employee together with the amount of wages, salaries and other
earnings shall be properly recorded by the Insured. iii. The Insured
shall at all times allow the Insurer to inspect such a record. The
Insured is required to submit to the Insurer a correct account of such a
wages, salaries and other earnings paid during the period of insurance
within one month from the expiry date of such a period of insurance iv.
If the amount of so paid shall differ from the amount on which premium
has been paid, the difference in premium shall be met by further
proportionate payment to the Insurance Company, or subject to the
Company's usual scale of minimum premiums, by refund of the company, as
the case may be. v. In the event of any extension or alteration of the
premises during the currency of the Policy, the Insured shall be
immediately notify the Company thereof and shall pay to the Company any
adjusted premium required in a respect of such extension or alteration.</p>
<h2 id="h-cancellation">h) Cancellation</h2>
<p>The Insurer may cancel the Policy by sending seven
day's notice to the Insured and in such an event will return to the
Insured the premium paid less the pro rata portion thereof for the
period the Policy has been in force.</p>
<h2 id="i-contribution">i) Contribution</h2>
<p>If there is any
other insurance covering the same damage or liability, the Insurer shall
not be liable to pay more than his rate able proportion of any damage,
compensation, costs or expenses.</p>
<p>In connection with any one claim or number of claims arising out of one
cause, the Insurance Company may pay to the Insured the amount of
indemnity payable under the policy, and upon such payment being made,
the Company shall relinquish the conduct and control of proceedings, and
be under no further liability in connection with such claim or claims
except for the payment of costs and expenses of litigation incurred
prior to the date of such payment.</p>
<h2 id="j-arbitration">j) Arbitration</h2>
<p>If any difference
shall arise as to the quantum of the claim, such difference shall be
referred to arbitration, as per the provisions of the Indian Arbitration
Act, 1996. It is clearly understood that no dispute could be referred to
arbitration if the company has disputed or not accepted liability under
the policy. If the company shall disclaim liability to the insured and
such claim shall not, within 12 calendar months from the date of such
disclaimer have been made the subject matter of suit in a Court of Law,
then the claim shall for all purpose be deemed to have been abandoned
and shall not thereafter be recoverable under the policy. The due
observance and fulfillment of the terms, exceptions, conditions and
endorsements of the Policy and the truth of the statement and answers in
the proposal shall be conditions precedent to any liability of the
Company to make any payment under this Policy. The Schedule of the
Policy: Amongst the other standard details, the Schedule contains the
estimated annual Wage roll of all the employees. Address and superficial
area of the Premises is also stated in the Schedule. Limits of Liability
under both the Sections of the Policy are shown and these limits have
already been discussed with the consideration of the two Sections of the

<li>New technologies in cars</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-rear-mounted-radar">Here is a collection of
technologies already offered that could be mainstream just a year or two
from now. Eight great new car gadgets:
a) Rear-mounted radar</h2>
<h2 id="b-night-vision-with-pedestrian-detection">b) Night vision with pedestrian detection</h2>
<h2 id="c-automatic-high-beam-control">c) Automatic high-beam control</h2>
<h2 id="d-parental-control">d) Parental control</h2>

<h2 id="f-cameras">f) Cameras</h2>
<h2 id="g-driver-capability">g) Driver capability</h2>
<h2 id="h-in-car-internet">h) In-car Internet</h2>
<p>a) Rear-mounted radar Backing out of a parking space
in a busy lot can be an adventure. Although rear-pointing radar has been
around for a few years alerting drivers to unseen objects immediately
behind them -- a fence, wall, tree or another vehicle -- new radar
technology searches for approaching cross traffic. When it &quot;sees&quot;
traffic approaching while you're backing up, it sounds an alarm.
Chrysler's version is available in its minivans and is called Cross
Path Detection System. It includes visual indicators in the outboard
mirrors. Ford's system is called Cross Traffic Alert. Offered in the
just-released 2010 Fusion and Mercury Milan, it also has outboard mirror
alarm indicators. b) Night vision with pedestrian detection Although
night vision in vehicles isn't a new technology, Cadillac offered it in
2000. The Mercedes-Benz updated version is called Night View Assist
Plus. Unlike the Night View Assist, which has been available in the
S-Class since 2005, the new system pinpoints pedestrians, highlighting
them on a dashboard display. It's offered in the 2010 E-Class in
showrooms late this spring. BMW has a similar system with a pedestrian
identifier that also shows the direction the pedestrian is moving. As
the distance closes between pedestrian and vehicle, a warning appears on
the night vision monitor as well as the head-up display on the
windshield if so equipped. BMW offers this system on the 2009 7 Series.</p>
<p>c) Automatic high-beam control In the redesigned RX, Lexus offers a
system that automatically illuminates and dims the high-beam headlights
in relation to approaching traffic. A camera mounted on the rearview
mirror detects when the vehicle is closing in on oncoming traffic, as
well as vehicles ahead traveling in the same direction, and disengages
the high beams. Mercedes-Benz takes the technology one step further with
its Adaptive High beam Assist. Also found in the new E-Class, it
doesn't merely switch between low and high beams, but reacts by
gradually increasing or lowering the light distribution based on the
distance of approaching traffic. It also dims the high beams for sharp
turns and then re-engages the high beams if there is no approaching
traffic once the turn is completed. d) Parental control Parents who are
afraid their teen driver might speed or be distracted by playing the
vehicle's audio system at an excessive volume can use Ford's new MyKey
system to limit speed and volume. When programmed, MyKey limits the
speed to 80 miles per hour. It can also be programmed to limit the audio
volume and to sound a continuous alarm if seat belts are left
unfastened. Eventually available in all Fords, MyKey is offered in the
recently released 2010 Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner Hybrid. e) GPS
vehicle tracking Parents wishing to expand on the Big Brother theme can
purchase the Live View GPS Live Trac PT-10. Retailing for $550 with a
$40 per month subscription fee, it is a GPS tracking system that
updates a vehicle's position every 10 seconds. Watching it live
requires only Internet access. Small and portable, the tracking device
can be moved from vehicle to vehicle. It can also alert parents through
their cell phone if the vehicle's preset speed threshold is exceeded or
if the vehicle enters/exits certain areas. It and similar Live View GPS
products are also handy tools for businesses that need to track their
fleet vehicles. f) Camera Not so many years ago there was an undeclared
competition among vehicle manufacturers to see who could scatter the
largest number of cup holders around a vehicle's interior. Now the
competition seems to have switched to cameras. Camera systems that
provide a view behind the vehicle when shifted into reverse are things
of yesterday.</p>
<p>The new trend is toward multiple cameras providing enlarged field of
view. Available on its current 7 Series, BMW's Valeo multi-camera
system employs three to five cameras, depending on the version, to
display a panoramic view when parking. Precise distances are indicated
by lines on the image. It also sounds an alarm when the vehicle closes
in on an unseen object during the maneuver. Infiniti's Around View
Monitor has four wide-angle cameras mounted in the front, rear and
sides, providing a bird's-eye, 360-degree view for parking purposes.
Distances are illustrated by color graphics, and a beeping alarm sounds
when the vehicle closes in on an object. It's available on the EX35 and
FX. g) Driver capability Although it might be beneficial to have a
system that evaluates driver&rsquo;s aptitude and shuts down the vehicle when
incompetence is detected, we aren't there yet. But technology exists
that measures a driver's fitness and issues warnings when a driver is
judged overly tired or impaired. Attention Assist, found in the 2010
Mercedes-Benz E-Class, remembers a driver's normal behavior behind the
wheel and establishes it as the driver's baseline profile. Continually
measuring factors such as speed, lateral acceleration, steering wheel
angle, pedal use and so forth, the system determines if there is any
deviation from the baseline. If so, it alerts the driver visually and
audibly that it's break time. Even external influences such as
crosswind and road surface are factored in. h) In-car Internet Although
pure Wi-Fi Internet access from a moving vehicle is still in the future
-- albeit the near future -- there are systems that allow for surfing
using cell phone technology. The first system to turn your vehicle into
a WiFi hotspot is Auto net Mobile. Using a portable router mounted in
the trunk or other out-of-the-way location, this system uses a 3G
network to supply an uninterrupted signal regardless of cell tower blind
spots, tunnels and so forth. In addition to the router, there is a
monthly subscription fee based on estimated usage. Chrysler currently
offers its UConnect Web system in several models while Ford offers a
system called ‗Ford Work Solutions&rsquo; on the current F-150 pickup truck
that primarily targets contractors. It dovetails several technologies
into an integrated system that can complete a variety of tasks from
maintaining your tool inventory to sending out invoices, creating
spreadsheets and surfing the Internet through the Sprint Mobile
Broadband Network. 116</p>
<p>2. In-car Technologies Strong interest in new In-Car Technologies by
consumers in emerging economies could influence demand, decelerate
rollout of next-generation connected vehicle. High interest in
next-generation in-car technologies among drivers in emerging economies
could help shape future demand for sales and provide the automotive
industry with a sustained revenue stream, a new survey by Accenture
indicates. The survey shows that drivers are twice as likely to choose a
car based on in-vehicle technology options, than its performance,
demonstrating the continued importance of the connected vehicle to the
automotive industry. ―Connected vehicle technology is rapidly becoming a
key car-purchasing criterion‖ The survey of 14,000 drivers in Brazil,
China, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, South Africa, South
Korea, Spain, the UK and the United States examined their current use of
connected vehicle technologies and expectations for future use.
Technologies and digital services covered by the survey included: i.
Navigation and traffic services; ii. A range of autonomous driving aids;
iii. In-car services, including entertainment, (a) Work tools and
learning; (b) Safety services; (c) Black box-type monitoring of a
person&rsquo;s driving patterns that can help reduce insurance premiums; and a
number of (d) Passenger-related services. Thirty-nine percent of the
drivers surveyed said that their primary consideration in choosing a new
automobile is in-car technology, compared with 14 percent who said
driving performance had the greatest influence on their choice.
According to the survey, drivers in China, Brazil, Indonesia and
Malaysia expressed the strongest interest in all of the connected
vehicle technologies and digital services currently available, which are
used widely by consumers in more mature markets. Among the respondents
in emerging economies, Chinese drivers had the highest current usage and
greatest desire for future use of most of the technologies and services,
followed by drivers in Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Africa.
―Combined with the increased use of connected vehicle technologies and
digital services among consumers in mature markets, the high demand
across the emerging world will no doubt speed the development and
influence the rollout of next-generation products and services by the
global auto industry.‖ IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>This is especially significant considering that nearly 40 percent of
drivers surveyed indicated that in-car technology is the primary factor
they consider in purchasing a new car. While there is ongoing debate
about the future and safety of driverless cars, Accenture&rsquo;s research
shows that, on average, 90 percent of the survey respondents have an
interest in some autonomous driving options, primarily those related to
safety. The most popular features include: i. Lane-changing warning
systems, ii. Collision-warning systems, iii. Lane-keeping systems, iv.
Automatic braking systems that prevent hitting an object and v. Fully
automatic parking. Accenture believes that the demand for individual
aspects of autonomous driving will encourage original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs), regulators and industry organizations to address
the issues that are currently preventing the widespread use of
driverless vehicle technology. The research uncovered strong interest
among consumers in vehicle health reports and vehicle lifecycle
management services. According to Accenture, OEMs that are able to tap
into this demand could open up new revenue streams around
maintenance-related digital services and engine and parts wear and tear.
While only 13 percent of drivers surveyed said they currently use a
vehicle health report and 12 percent use vehicle lifecycle management
services, 39 percent and 37 percent, respectively, expect to start using
these services soon. This increasing level of demand could lead to the
rise of concierge-type digital services as drivers outsource the
real-time monitoring of engine performance to third-party service
providers, expanding the OEM after-sales revenue model. However, as
drivers increase their demand for next-generation connected vehicle
technologies across: i. Navigation, ii. Infotainment, iii. Safety, iv.
Autonomous driving and v. Mobile device integration, Vehicle
manufacturers face a challenge in being able to meet the complex
integration requirements of a broad array of technologies in each range
of vehicles. They must also look at maximizing sales by incorporating
the right technologies into the appropriate vehicle range in each
country. Accenture believes that the ability to source data from
vehicles will enable a range of new business-to-business and
business-to-consumer digital services. For OEMs, detailed data from
vehicles could help them:</p>
<p>i. Improve their engineering processes, ii. Reduce warranty costs and
iii. Improve their relationships with dealers by helping dealers manage
parts inventory and service. Data sourced from vehicles could also be
used to enable a portfolio of valueadded B2C services, including vehicle
diagnostics, driving dashboards and concierge services, delivered to
drivers through multiple devices: a vehicle&rsquo;s head unit, a driver&rsquo;s
Smartphone and/or tablet. 3. Future car technologies Automobile
propulsion technologies under development include: i. petrol / electric
and plug-in hybrids, ii. battery electric vehicles, iii. hydrogen cars,
iv. bio fuels, and various alternative fuels Research into future
alternative forms of power include the development of fuel cells,
Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), Sterling engines, and
even using the stored energy of compressed air or liquid nitrogen. New
materials which may replace steel car bodies include duraluminum,
fiberglass, carbon fiber, and carbon nano tubes. Telematics technology
is allowing more and more people to share cars, on a pay&ndash;as&ndash;you-go
basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also
evolving due to connected car systems. 4. New technology in auto field
a) Zero accident rate Google&rsquo;s driverless car has now clocked more than
300 000 miles without a single accident whilst under the computer&rsquo;s
control, raising the possibility of a future of driverless vehicles.
Should such technology be widely adopted which could be the answer to
reducing the road accidents and may even result in reduced insurance
premiums.</p>
<p>Experts believe that due to the system&rsquo;s accuracy, driverless vehicles
could help reduce the number of fatalities that occur on the roads
daily. ―The extent of motor vehicle accidents remains a serious problem
in India and is most often the result of human error. Consequently, a
driverless system could help to eradicate careless and negligent driving
behaviour, thereby reducing the number of accidents. If this is the
case, and fewer accidents occur, then the cars could also be built
lighter, allowing for less fuel consumption.‖ If the risks posed by
driverless vehicles do prove to be less than those posed by traditional
vehicles, the insurance premium charged should also reduce. b) Constant
cross communication In theory, this would make the industry even more
competitive, forcing insurance companies to include additional value
added services to make their respective offerings more attractive.
However, while the traditional risks posed by driver driven vehicles may
be substantially mitigated, the reality is that it will take a long time
for cars to be introduced with the new driverless system and to be able
to drive on the streets with absolute autonomy. Compatibility of all
vehicles to enable constant cross communication with each other is the
crux here as otherwise the sizeable benefits offered by such a system
would soon to be obsolete. c) Sluggish take up of this technology As a
result, a major concern for any insurance company that opts to provide a
reduced premium in response to the driverless system being implemented
is that a sluggish take up of this technology would mean that the risks
posed by other drivers on the roads would remain as widespread as
before. Even with a high take-up of driverless vehicles, the
introduction of such technology would mean insurance contracts would
certainly have to be revisited. ―With an insurance policy being a
contract between the insurer and the insured, certain terms and
conditions may need to be tweaked in order to ensure that comprehensive
cover is not compromised.‖ Exclusions such as driving under the
influence of alcohol (DUIA) may no longer need to be applied. However,
one of the most contentious legal issues may be that of third party
claims. The fact that you are no longer driving the car, but rather the
car is driving it raises a number of questions:  Can someone still be
sued in his or her personal capacity?  Would the owner or driver of the
vehicle now assume the negligent position of the vehicle?</p>
<p>The qualifying criteria for negligence to exist may now have to
question:  Would the reasonable person (vehicle) have foreseen the
consequence of his/her (its) actions?  Would the reasonable vehicle
have taken the necessary steps to safeguard against this consequence?
and lastly  Did this vehicle take the necessary steps to safeguard
against such a consequence?‖ The introduction of this new mode of
transport would also require transport laws to be revisited. ―This will
include legislation regarding speaking on the cell phone whilst driving,
licensing of vehicles and drivers, as well as the possible impact on
claims submitted against the Road Accident. ―The principle behind
driverless technology is very positive and so far the technology appears
to be proving a success. However, the phasing in of this type of
technology will take a long time, especially in emerging markets where
older cars remain on the roads for far longer‖.</p>
