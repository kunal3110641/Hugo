<li>Dysfunctional Motor Market</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The introduction of private insurers in India in 2000 following the passing of the
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) Act has brought
about intense competition in the market for insurance business. Non-life
i.e., general insurance business too has been exposed to this
competition. However the existence of the Tariffs in Fire, Motor
Engineering and Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation muted this competition to some
extent. There has been a cut-throat competition in the other non-life
business and a scramble for the best risks in the Tariff business. As
the restrictions of the Tariff were seen to be a barrier for
differentiation of product and development of new products, the insurers
were demanding scrapping of the tariffs and freedom to devise policy
wordings and determine rates to grow in the market. Motor insurance
commands a large slice of the miscellaneous insurance business in India.
Unfortunately it also has the highest claim ratio due to Third Party
Liability predominately due to Commercial Vehicles. The advent of
private insurers saw a skewed development in the motor portfolio. The
more profitable private car and two wheeler business was targeted by the
private insurers and the commercial vehicles were left to the public
sector insurers, who could not refuse to insure against Third Party
risks as they were mandated to insure in terms of the Motor Vehicle Act
1988. They thus opposed detariffing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Motor Third Party Pool</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Motor Third Party outstanding liabilities were bleeding the insurance industry
and the fear that de-tariff would result in public sector insurers going
under due to this was also a grave possibility. Arising out of the need
to see the development of the insurance market in India and ensuring
that policyholder rights were not compromised by such developments, the
IRDAI mandated the creation of a Motor Third Party Pool in December
2006. The pool is applicable only for Commercial Vehicles wherein an
arrangement is made to share losses in proportion to the market share of
the insurers.</p>
<h2 id="a-pooling-arrangement">a) Pooling Arrangement</h2>
<p>As stated by IRDAI in its circular
035/IRDA/motor-TP/2006 of 4th December, 2006 ―Whereas several complaints
have been received regarding non-availability of motor third party
insurance especially for commercial vehicles; and whereas insurers have
been expressing difficulty to underwrite this business unless they are
permitted to charge premium rates that they consider appropriate.</p>
<p>And whereas considering the mandatory nature of motor third party
insurance business it is necessary for the Authority to monitor the
rates, terms and conditions of cover for the time being; and whereas it
is in public interest to ensure that all insurers registered to carry on
general insurance business including motor insurance business actively
participate in providing such cover to vehicle owners at rates as
notified by the Authority from time to time; Now therefore, the
Authority, after consultation with the Committee constituted under
Section 110G of the Insurance Act, hereby directs that all general
insurers registered to carry on general insurance business (including
motor insurance business) or general reinsurance business shall
collectively participate in a pooling arrangement to share in all motor
third party insurance business underwritten by any of the registered
general insurers in accordance with the following provisions.</p>
<h2 id="b-pooling-procedure">b) Pooling Procedure</h2>
<p>i.Participation in pooling arrangement</p>
<p>Every insurer registered to carry on general insurance business
(including motor insurance business) or general reinsurance business
shall automatically participate in the pooling arrangement to the extent
set out herein. ii. Underwriting insurers Every underwriting office of
every insurer that is authorised to underwrite motor insurance business
for the insurer shall also be authorised to underwrite motor third party
insurance business that will be shared among all insurers through the
pooling arrangement. iii. Pooling mechanism The pooling of business
among all insurers will be achieved through a multilateral reinsurance
arrangement between the underwriting insurer and all the other
registered insurers carrying on general insurance business (including
motor insurance business) and general insurance reinsurers. iv.
Participation in motor third party insurance pooled business The
participation of General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC Re) in the
pooled business shall be such percentage of the motor business that is
ceded to it by all insurers as statutory reinsurance cessions under
Section 101A of the Insurance Act. The business remaining after such
cession to GIC Re shall be shared among all the registered general
insurers writing motor insurance business in proportion to the gross
direct general insurance premium in all classes of general insurance
underwritten by them in that financial year.</p>
<p>v. Underwriting of business Underwriting offices of insurers shall
follow the underwriting instructions of the General Insurance Council of
India in the matter of procedures for underwriting and documentation and
accounting and settlement of balances. The business shall be
underwritten at rates and terms and conditions of cover as notified by
the Authority from time to time. No vehicle owner shall be denied third
party insurance cover in respect of his vehicle which is holding a valid
permit for use on public roads except on grounds of attempted fraud. vi.
Claims processing and settlement All claims in respect of third party
death or injury or physical damage shall be processed for settlement in
a speedy and efficient manner in accordance with the instructions of the
General Insurance Council of India. For this purpose, the Council shall
adopt a pro-active claims settlement policy adopting the most efficient
claims processing practices possible. vii. Administration of the pooling
arrangement The GIC Re shall act as the administrator of the pooling
arrangement. It will act under the guidance of the General Insurance
Council of India. For this purpose, the Council may establish such
Committees of insurers as are necessary to operate the pooling
arrangement and process and settle claims in the most efficient manner.
viii. Remuneration There will be no agency commission or brokerage
payable in respect of motor third party insurance business. (a) The
underwriting insurer will be paid a reinsurance commission of 10% on the
premium ceded by it to all the other insurers and reinsurers. (b) The
GIC Re as administrator shall be paid a fee of 2.5% of the total premium
on motor third party insurance business in respect of the business
underwritten for the pooled account. Each insurer shall bear the cost of
hardware required to operate the pooling arrangement within its offices.
The GIC will bear the cost of hardware necessary to administer the
pooling arrangement in its offices. The cost of the operating software
for the pooling arrangement shall be shared by all the insurers and
reinsurers in the manner decided by the General Insurance Council of
India. Each insurer shall bear the cost of travel of its executives to
attend to the work relating to the pooling arrangement. However, any
travel specifically to service a claim shall be recoverable as claims
related expenses.</p>
<p>ix. Agreement The insurers and GIC Re shall enter into a multi-lateral
reinsurance arrangement to give effect to this pooling scheme. x. Review
The Authority will review the operation of the pooling arrangement and
the need for regulation of the premium rates and terms of cover and will
issue such directions from time to time as may be considered necessary.
xi. All non-life insurers will be a party to the pooling of the risk of
TP insurance The directions of the IRDA thus specify that all insurers,
in the non-life other than health insurance business will be a party to
the pooling of the risk of TP insurance. All offices of insurers are
required to underwrite such business. xii. Pooling of the business will
be shared by a reinsurance arrangement The pooling of the business will
be shared by a reinsurance arrangement involving the underwriting office
as ceding insurer and other insurers and reinsurers; as GIC Re is the
only operating reinsurer in the market at present, GIC Re will also
participate in the pool; as ceded reinsurers. Future insurance and
reinsurance companies will automatically participate in this pool. xiii.
GIC‟s share is 15% The sharing arrangement will be in the case of GIC Re
its statutory reinsurance sessions, this is presently 15 %, hence GIC&rsquo;s
share will be 15% of the TP pool. With regard to other insurers, the
balance 85% will be in proportion to their Gross Direct Insurance
premium (GDPI) for the underwriting year. Example: New India&rsquo;s GDPI is
17% and ICICI Lombard is 12%, they will share the balance 85% in
proportion of 17% and 12% respectively. xiv. Role of the General
Insurance Council: Laying rules and procedures The General Insurance
Council of India- a body representing all non-life insurers- has been
given the authority to lay down the rules and procedures for
underwriting, accounting and settlement. The rates and terms for TP
insurance are to be decided by the IRDA. In effect motor TP insurance
will continue under tariff.</p>
<p>xv. Role of the General Insurance Council: Ensuring smooth functioning
and timely claim settlement The General Insurance Council will also
ensure smooth functioning and timely settlement of claims. The pool will
be administered by the GIC. The IRDA notification also lays down the
commission and remuneration fees for the arrangement. xvi. Claim
settlement only for commercial vehicle insurance The Motor Third Party
pool came into existence in January 2007. However the pool is
functioning only for claims reported for Commercial Vehicle insurance.
The General Insurance Corporation is managing the funds received from
the insurers as their share of the premium to the pool. The
administration of the underwriting and the claims are managed by the
respective insurers at all stages including settlement. On settlement
they are submitting the details of the claims settled and recovering
their share of payment from the pool.</p>
<h2 id="c-review-of-pool">c) Review of Pool</h2>
<p>As the time line between claims reported and settled in the case of Third Party Liability
averages 5-7 years, a correct picture on the functioning and success of
the pool cannot be ascertained at the present time. There is a provision
for reviewing the arrangement and the General Insurance Council as the
authority will convey its views to the IRDAI at the appropriate time. i.</p>
<p>No profit &ndash; no loss business: No ceding commission</p>
<p>Since the motor third party business is expected to run on a ‗no profit
no loss&rsquo; basis, there shall be no ceding commission in respect of the
business ceded to the pool with effect from 1/4/2010. ii. Investment of
funds as per IRDA‟s Investment Regulations It will be obligatory on the
part of the insurance companies to segregate funds on account of the
pool business in their accounts and invest them in a manner as provided
in the IRDAI&rsquo;s Investment Regulations. iii. Details to be confirmed by
statutory auditors The business transacted by insurance companies on
account of pool and also investment of the funds shall be specifically
confirmed by the statutory auditors of the company in the annual
accounts of the company.</p>
<p>iv. Details to be confirmed by Appointed Actuary The Appointed Actuary
of the insurance company shall also confirm in his annual report, the
incorporation of the pool liabilities, including revisions in the
company&rsquo;s accounts. v. Quarterly remittance of funds to the pool
administrator Each member company shall be responsible for remittance of
monies to the pool administrator on a quarterly basis along with the
quarterly statements. Any delay in remittance shall attract interest for
delayed payment @ 10% p.a. as agreed between the pool members in the
meeting of the General Insurance Council. The pool administrator shall
continue to prepare and submit half yearly and annually audited accounts
for the pool and also appointed actuary&rsquo;s annual report. The annual
audited accounts shall also incorporate any revision in liabilities. vi.
Periodical inspections of the member companies Pool administrator shall
conduct periodical inspections of the member companies to assess their
efficiency in settlement of claims and also verify the accuracy of the
quarterly statements in respect of the pool business. vii. Fees of 1.25%
of the premium to the pool administrator The fees of 1.25% of the
premium to the pool administrator will continue until revised. As has
been decided by the members in the General Insurance Council meeting
held on 29/01/2008 all operational expenses (including hardware and
software) shall continue to be met by the pool administrator. viii. Data
upload from companies to pool administrator The automated transaction
level data (data upload) will continue to flow from the companies to the
pool administrator as at present.</p>
<h2 id="d-dismantling-of-third-party-pool">d) Dismantling of Third Party Pool</h2>
<p>i.Arguments by private insurers: The third-party pool, introduced in 2007,
has been criticised by private insurers saying they are forced to bear
the burden for sloppy due diligence done by public sector general
insurers.</p>
<p>ii. Arguments by state insurers: But the state-run insurers say their
presence across the nation, even in smaller towns unlike private ones
that cherry pick customers in cities make them vulnerable to
disproportionate claims. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>Motor Third Party Pool had become the biggest insurance company in
itself although; efficiency of managing claims was low. New India
Assurance had plunged into losses in 2012 for the first time in 91 years
due to the impact of third-party motor pool. The regulator has to relax
solvency margin stipulations for next three years to keep general
insurance companies afloat. The current pool is likely to see around 4
lakh claims this year, and is forecast to get a contribution of around
Rs. 5,400 crores. But the payout may be around Rs. 8,000 crore,
inflicting losses on every insurer. Public sector general insurers have
lost more than Rs. 25,000 crore in the past 20-30 years.</p>
<h2 id="e-declined-risk-pool">e) Declined Risk Pool</h2>
<p>The Indian Motor Third Party Declined Risk Insurance Pool
operates in the auto arena for the commercial vehicles to have i.
equitable and fair sharing by all insurers, i . simplicity to administer
and ii. . to bring claims management efficiency The policy of Declined
Risk Insurance Pool applies to all commercial vehicles for standalone
third party insurance (Act only Insurance). The new pool structure is an
important first step towards addressing the issues around commercial
vehicle third-party insurance and reforming them, the structure is
simple to implement and ensures there are no supply-side constraints on
availability of insurance covers. The new plan provides an option to
insurance companies to choose the liabilities they would bear totally,
meaning they would pay up 100% of the claims. Where they see high
claims, such as on trucks, they can dip into the pool, where every
insurer contributes depending on its market share. The latest move by
IRDAI will enable insurers to decide on whether they want to write the
third-party liabilities in a policy involving a Maruti car, or a
Mercedes Benz, or a Tata truck. Decline Risk Pool: They could choose to
pay up claims in cities where accidents may be less frequent, while
transferring to pool those coming from hinterland, where there are more
accidents. This, in insurance parlance, is called 'declining risk
pool'. Due to the high claims ratio of around 140 per cent from
commercial vehicles, insurance companies are providing them cover from a
common declined pool and not from their own books. The declined pool has
completed two years which has given leverage to study loss trends and
the kind of vehicles that come into the pool. 48</p>
<p>IRDA fixes tariffs for third party motor insurance premiums to ensure
that there are no supply-side constraints, that is, vehicles considered
high risk are not denied cover. The size of the declined pool, at Rs.
400 crores, is small which means that more insurance companies are
underwriting risk on their own books moving away from a
one-size-fits-all premium for vehicles.</p>

<ol>
<li>Knock for Knock Agreement</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-claim-under-own-damage-and-third-party-section">a) Claim under „Own Damage‟ and „Third Party‟ Section</h2>
<p>If two vehicles are involved in collision and one of the vehicles is
negligent, the owner of the other vehicle can recover damages from the
negligent owner of the vehicle. If he chooses to claim from his own
insurer under 'Own damage' section of the policy, then his insurer
would be subrogated to his rights of recovery against the negligent
owner. The latter would be having his insurance policy and his insurers
may have to pay the claim under Third Party Section of the Policy. This
would mean that, in all cases, where insurance is involved, such claims
are settled as between the respective insurers. Since question of
negligence are involved these would have to be settled by litigation
between insurers which is an expensive and time consuming process.
Eventually the costs of litigation would be reflected in the premium
rates.</p>
<h2 id="b-knock-for-knock-agreement">b) Knock for Knock Agreement</h2>
<p>Therefore, insurers have entered
into an agreement (called Knock for Knock Agreement) according to which,
irrespective of who was negligent, provided the damage is covered under
the policy, the insurers covering the damage will not exercise
subrogation rights against the party involved in the accident. Instead,
they will indemnify their insured subject to the terms of policy.
Similarly, the other insurers will indemnify their insured provided the
damage is covered under the policy. In other words, each insurer will
indemnify their insured. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>KNOCK FOR KNOCK AGREEMENT AND SOME MARKET PRACTICES</p>
<p>This agreement, however, does not apply to goods vehicles policies and
Public Service Vehicles (i.e. Taxies, Buses) used for hire or reward,
and technically the Insurers are free to enter into litigation to
recover losses caused by such vehicles. The knock for knock agreement
benefits: i.</p>
<p>the insurers as they avoid intercompany litigation and thereby save
costs;</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. it benefits the insured‟s because they recover the claims straightaway
from their insurers;</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. it also benefits the insuring public because the reduction in the cost
claims is eventually reflected in reduced premiums</p>
<p>Third-party insurance policy is a mandatory cover for any vehicle plying
in the public place. The cover pays for the damages to a third person
that is caused due to insured vehicle. But when the accident involves
damage to the vehicles, the insurers pay for the damages through their
own damage covers and not by invoking the third-party cover on the
insurer whose insured customer is at fault. This is called the
knock-for-knock agreement.</p>
<p>Definition The dictionary defines the term „knock for knock‟ as an
agreement between auto insurers that in the event of an accident each
insurance company will pay for the damage to the vehicle insured with
it, without attempting to establish blame for the accident. c)
Difference between Own Damage and Third-Party Covers Own damage policy
covers damages and theft of the vehicle.
i.The sum insured or the maximum liability of the insurer in an own damage
cover is determined by the insured&rsquo;s declared value (IDV).</p>
<p>i. The third-party cover, on the other hand, has a limited liability of
Rs. 7.5 lakh in case of damage to the vehicle or property of the third
person and</p>
<p>i. Unlimited liability in case of bodily injury or loss of life</p>
<p>Third-party cases are fought at the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals and
the amount of compensation to the third party is decided by the Court.</p>
<p>d) Why do Insurers have this Agreement? Every year the insurers sign a
knock-for-knock agreement with all other insurers. The insurers do so to
avoid getting into litigation and unnecessary delays by dragging the
matter to the court on account of third-party policies. So instead of
finding whose fault it is and making the insurer compensate the victim,
both the insurers of both the vehicles pay for the damages of their
insured vehicles respectively. This is an internal understanding among
the insurers and is not mandated by the regulator. It&rsquo;s quite a toss-up
between a quick turnaround time in claims settlement and no-claims bonus
earned by the claimant. By invoking the own damage cover, the insured
will end up forgoing the no-claim bonus that he is entitled to for every
claim-free year. This bonus is a discount in the premium and can go up
to 50% of the premium. So insured will need to evaluate what would you
rather settle for: i.</p>
<p>A quick turn around by allowing the insurer to cover damages under the
own damage policy or</p>
<p>i . Protecting the no-claim bonus on the own damage cover by going to
the court considering you were not at fault.</p>

<li>International Issues in Insurance Markets</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-international-driving-permit-idp">a) International Driving Permit (IDP)</h2>
<p>An IDP is a permit for use in conjunction with your driving licence, not in place of
it. In some countries, you risk being fined or worse for relying solely
on an IDP. IDP applications can only be made up to three months in
advance. An IDP may be post-dated up to three months in advance but,
under no circumstances can it be backdated. If a person is going for
more than three months, to live or to work, or for any reason other than
tourism, one should make enquiries about his personal position before
relying on a permit. Driving licence requirements vary worldwide.
Therefore, while hiring a car overseas ask the company concerned to
confirm driving licence requirements of the country to be visited. In
the absence of such information an IDP is just a precautionary measure,
especially if travelling outside Europe.</p>
<p>International Driving Permit is issued to an applicant who holds a valid
Indian Licence and who is a resident of India. The application has to be
made in Form IDP or in writing to the RTO within whose jurisdiction the
applicant resides, specifying the countries to be visited and the
duration of stay etc. The validity of this permit is for one year. You
are required to get your licence from the country you are visiting
within one year period. IDP Requirements i. Valid Driving Licence held
by the applicant and copies thereon. i . Copies of Passport, visa where
applicable) and Air ticket verification. i i. Attested copy of valid
address proof. iv. Five passport size photographs. v. Medical Form 1-A
vi. Valid proof of Indian Nationals. vi . Fees as prescribed along with
user charges International driving document is intended to overcome the
difficulties the drivers might have while traveling by car in other
countries where license requirements may widely vary. b) International
Translation of Driver‟s License International driving document is a
legal translation of national driver's license. By itself IDL is not
valid for driving in United States. It's merely confirms that you hold
a valid license in your home country. Every time you drive you should
have with you both things: i.</p>
<p>Your National Driver&rsquo;s License and</p>
<p>i . International Translation of Driver&rsquo;s License The authorisation for
the International driving document has its basis in International
Conventions on Road Safety (in 1923, 1943, 1949 and 1968). The basic
information is translated into 8 languages. There is a list of countries
which signed United Nations Convention on Road Traffic and accepted
International driving document. International Translation of driver's
License is accomplished by IADC in two parts: i.</p>
<p>The booklet in dark-blue color is valid for 1 year</p>
<p>i . The plastic card (membership card) is valid for 10 years Current
driver&rsquo;s license must accompany the international driving document in
order for it to be valid.</p>
<h2 id="ponder-over-this">Ponder Over This</h2>
<p>Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Aston Martin are the
illegally imported luxury cars in India. Foreign luxury cars carry a
high import duty, prompting buyers to find ways of evading the payment.
The government had raised the basic import duty on luxury cars to 100%
in Budget 2013. A Lamborghini costs upwards of Rs. 1.5 crores. After
paying the basic customs duty, countervailing duty and other taxes,
which effectively amount to around 160%, a buyer has to shell out around
Rs. 3.9 crore to bring the car to India. In western India alone, 137
luxury cars have been identified which have been imported fraudulently
by misusing government norms. Most of the illegally imported cars that
have been seized by DRI were sold off to rich, wellknown individuals at
a cheaper price. The Daily News and Analysis (on 8 August 2012) reported
that the Lokayukta special court in Bangalore had ordered a probe into
the import of cars, especially of marquee brands such as the Bentley and
Ferrari, into Karnataka. An analysis of the cases booked in the last
five years reveals that a majority of fraudulent luxury car imports have
taken place through forged invoices and import documents and misuse of
the transfer of residence facility.</p>
<h2 id="itransfer-of-residence-facility">i.Transfer of residence facility</h2>
<p>The first route for such illegal import of vehicles is the transfer of
residence facility which entitles duty concessions on personal and
household goods to people who are returning to India from a foreign
country after a stay of at least two years. On motor vehicles, it also
allows for depreciation to be charged in slabs &mdash; 16% for the first
year, 12% for the second year and so on. Operators typically forge
invoices by changing, for instance, the value of the vehicle and the
year of manufacture which allows them to cut duty. In other cases, they
forge import documents and impersonate people who have settled in India.
According to official, the key accused in a car import racket used to
import vehicles from them in Mumbai and Delhi under fake names. He
declined to give details.</p>
<h2 id="ii-export-promotion-capital-goods-epcg-scheme">ii. Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme</h2>
<p>The second route to
evade taxes is under the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) Scheme
whereby hotels, travel agents, tour operators and companies owning or
operating golf resorts &mdash; whose total foreign exchange earnings from
their main business in the current and preceding three licensing years
is Rs. 1.5 crore or more &mdash; can import sports utility vehicles at a 3%
concessional rate of duty. The importers tend to overstate their foreign
exchange earnings to meet the EPCG criteria and imported luxury cars
that are later sold to local operators in India who, in turn, sell these
cars to high net worth individuals (HNI) at a lower price. (First
Published: Thu, Mar 21 2013 11:58 PM IST) The whole activity needs to be
closely watched while insuring such illegally imported vehicles met with
an accident. The insurers have to be cautious while settling such claims
based on fraudulent documents resulting in excessive out go.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Some Market Practices</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The opening up of the insurance sector has brought
innovation in products and practices in insurance industry. New
intermediary channels like Corporate Agents, Bancassurance, Insurance
Broking and new products are surfacing with new market practices to stay
in competition. Diagram 1: Some Market Practices</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-motor/Marketing_in_motor_insurance-21.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="a-motor-insurance-online">a) Motor Insurance Online</h2>
<p>When an insured buys Motor Insurance online,
he get an instant policy, as there is no documentation or paperwork
involved. In addition, he has the advantage of choosing from multiple
payment options e.g. Credit card (Visa, Master, Amex card), Net banking,
Debit card etc. Currently only private cars and two-wheelers can be
insured online.  b) Motor Insurance Renewal Online The insured can renew
his policy online, starting 60 days before expiry of existing policy. In
case the vehicle insurance policy has already expired, authorised
surveyor would require an inspection of the vehicle, before policy
issuance. The policy would only be issued subject to a satisfactory
inspection and submission or required documents. c) Role of
Manufacturers The auto manufacturers have always had an important role
to play in marketing of motor insurance. From the time it provided ‗any
colour of car as long as it was black&rsquo;, graduating to ‗design your own
car with all luxury and comforts&rsquo; and the legal requirement of safer,
accident free vehicles has always been the obligation to be met by the
manufacturer. In the process various statutory and mandatory approvals
for containing pollution, crash test, CNG / LPG use, seat belt, helmet
etc. In USA it is not the banker but insurer who drives the sale of car
depending on the premium to be borne based on technology used and
reparability of vehicle. The manufacturers must disclose crash test
results, duration and availability of spares, for a specific make of the
vehicle, reparability of parts, man hours required for repair, workshop
facility at dealers end, emergency services etc. to decide claims out
go, thereby, determining adequate premium. d) Dealers in Auto Insurance
Auto dealers not only sell new vehicles but also provide servicing and
maintenance of cars as authorised dealers. Dealers also sell used cars,
either used by them for demo purpose as brand new vehicles and hand over
vehicles without full payment and transfer of ownership to prospective
buyers while accidental cars are sold as new cars with warranties.
Manufacturers provide standardised labour schedules to authorised
dealers, based upon high overhead costs and wage factor. Insurers should
discuss with manufacturers to keep a check on prohibitive cost of
insurance. Manufacturers in USA approach insurers unlike India to keep
cost of spares replacement and labour charge low.</p>
<p>The dealer is required to arrange for mandatory registration of the
vehicle as per law; this has opened up the requirement of arranging
compulsory insurance. Most of the auto dealers in India have tied up
with a particular insurance company that provides car insurance. It is
not mandatory to take up insurance from your car dealer. You can always
buy car insurance from your choice of insurance provider. The insurers
tie up with dealers to provide remote access of their motor insurance
platform allowing dealer to issue insurance policy with built-in
validations. Some of the insurers authorise dealers to issue even
renewals subject to adherence to break-in insurance rules, past loss
experience etc. These dealers at times become Corporate Agents
distributing insurance products while providing repair facilities in
their manufacturer&rsquo;s authorised workshops. Dealers giving bulk business
as Corporate Agents have off late been found exaggerating charges for
painting and labour and favouring replacement of parts on one hand while
try to keep low salvage (value for scrap) and avoid repairs at the
pretext of compromising the performance of the vehicle. e) Preferred
Garages The insurers also tie up with preferred garages to extend
cashless facility if the vehicle is brought to them. Some insurers have
developed their own garage and research facilities which arrange repairs
and provide alternate vehicle of same make to its insured claimant.</p>
<h2 id="igarages">i.Garages</h2>
<p>Garages are service centers which provide repair services to new or old
vehicles alike. They sometimes sub-contract some specialised job work.
These garages are graded and some of them are government approved.
Sometimes even insurers also approve the garages and expect certain
minimum service level to be adhered to by way of providing free towage
and delivery of vehicles and free servicing etc. The garages at time
provide comprehensive services at cheaper rates compared to aurthorised
dealers. These composite garages are labour oriented and use local make
items, parts or disposal items. 75% of the accidental vehicles go to
such composite garages for repairs. The overheads of these garages are
low and repair work is distributed to sub-contractors according to their
specialisation.</p>
<p>ii. Whether we need cheaper repairs or proper repairs? The cheaper
repairs through replacement by sub-standard parts and such cooked
(jugad) repairs lead to compromised performance of repaired vehicles and
results in higher outgo later due to being prone to aggravation in
accident cost in future. Concept of standardisation of labour is based
on man hours and man hour rate. Man hours are the normal time taken by
the normal work force to complete the job. Man hour rate primarily
depends upon wages, infrastructure overheads of the garage. Standardised
Labour Schedules are prepared by manufacturers and implemented by their
authorised dealers. 50% or in some case 100% more than the labour rates
prevalent in local / composite garages. Labour charges of the dealers
are cumulative whereas they should be overall and inclusive. This makes
a difference of about 25% to 30%. iii. Dealers Garages Dealer garages
are replacement oriented. Replacements are costly as the parts are
billed as per list price. Labour is charged on the basis of inflated
overheads and wages resulting in a higher man-hour rate and need
standardisation in labour cost. f) Test Drive Vehicle The vehicles are
marketed in streets and by lanes in our country to reach to customer at
his door. Test drives are being advertised as a comfort zone provided by
dealer to satisfy the consumer about new features of the vehicle. A new
concept of selling on road side make shift arrangements is also coming
in vogue. g) Pay As You Drive (PAYD) Pay As You Drive (PAYD) motor
policies are a new concept of insurance contracts ... also called Usage
Based Insurance (UBI) because, instead of an annual premium be
established, the premium is fixed according to the number of kilometers
done by the car, besides other characteristics of the risk traditionally
used in pricing. Therefore, those who use the car more are going to pay
a higher premium because they are more exposed to the risk of accident.
In the face of high auto insurance premiums, insurance companies have
been responding with potentially cheaper, pay-as-you-drive plans that,
for billing purposes, undertake GPS tracking when, how, how much and
where drivers use their vehicles instead of basing rates on statistics
and past trends.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>While cars with General Motors' On Star service and Ford's
Sync can use those systems to transmit driving data to insurance
companies, vehicles that don't have GPS-based computer standard, need
to have GPS-based tracking devices retrofitted to their vehicles. Not
only are some people worried about insurance companies watching their
every move while driving - depending on the plan, providers can penalise
drivers for when and where they drive their car - but the black box-like
devices are somewhat expensive. Customers also have to pay every month
to have data transmitted to their insurance providers. It&rsquo;s almost
inevitable that new cars will come equipped with GPS-based tracking
devices in the foreseeable future, so some of the issues with
payas-you-drive insurance plans could go away. One can distinctly find
three types of policies, based on how privacyinvasive they are. i. Some
of them do not imply any breach of privacy since the data about the
amount of kilometers traveled (no location information) needed to
compute the premium, is provided only once a year from a fixed location.
i. . The second type, despite not recording location information,
collects data in geographically distributed points, which allow the
insurance to estimate the movements of the user. i. . Finally, the last
model collects GPS data to track all the car&rsquo;s movements. In the rest of
the section, we present real-world systems that fit in these three
categories.</p>
<h2 id="h-drive-less-pay-less">h) Drive Less Pay Less</h2>
<p>Drive Less Pay Less are some of the
concepts which are gaining ground due to rising fuel costs and
increasing traffic congestions. The concept of underwriting on the basis
of make model and carrying capacity do not provide equal ground. The
Supreme Court of India has recommended the Government to provide
identical ground to all users of vehicle on the basis of its use by
mulling on petrol cess or kilometer traversed by a vehicle. i) Rent A
Car The vehicles of various categories are available on rent from Motor
Cycles / Scooters to Buses on Hire / Charter basis for the convenience
of consumers. The consumer is required to possess valid and effective
driving licence and pay a nominal amount as deposit to hire a vehicle
duly insured for damage to the vehicle or liability to third party
property damage or bodily injury. 58</p>

<h2 id="summary">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Summary a) As the restrictions of the Tariff were seen to be a barrier
for differentiation of product and development of new products, the
insurers were demanding scrapping of the tariffs and freedom to devise
policy wordings and determine rates to grow in the market. b) Motor
insurance commands a large slice of the miscellaneous insurance business
in India. Unfortunately it also has the highest claim ratio due to Third
Party Liability, predominately due to Commercial Vehicles. c) Arising
out of the need to see the development of the insurance market in India
and ensuring that policyholder rights were not compromised by such
developments, the IRDA mandated the creation of a Motor Third Party Pool
in December 2006. The pool is applicable only for Commercial Vehicles
wherein an arrangement is made to share losses in proportion to the
market share of the insurers. d) The pooling of business among all
insurers will be achieved through a multilateral reinsurance arrangement
between the underwriting insurer and all the other registered insurers
carrying on general insurance business (including motor insurance
business) and general insurance reinsurers. e) Underwriting offices of
insurers shall follow the underwriting instructions of the General
Insurance Council of India in the matter of procedures for underwriting
and documentation and accounting and settlement of balances. f) There
will be no agency commission or brokerage payable in respect of motor
third party insurance business. g) The GIC Re as administrator shall be
paid a fee of 2.5% of the total premium on motor third party insurance
business in respect of the business underwritten for the pooled account.
h) The sharing arrangement will be in the case of GIC its statutory
reinsurance sessions, this is presently 15 %, hence GIC Re&rsquo;s share will
be 15% of the TP pool. i) The General Insurance Council of India has
been given the authority to lay down the rules and procedures for
underwriting, accounting and settlement. j) It will be obligatory on the
part of the insurance companies to segregate funds on account of the
pool business in their accounts and invest them in a manner as provided
in the IRDA&rsquo;s Investment Regulations.</p>
<p>k) Pool administrator shall conduct periodical inspections of the
member companies to assess their efficiency in settlement of claims and
also verify the accuracy of the quarterly statements in respect of the
pool business. l) The Indian Motor Third Party Declined Risk Insurance

supply-side constraints, that is, vehicles considered high risk are not
denied cover. o) According to Knock for Knock Agreement, irrespective of
who was negligent, provided the damage is covered under the policy, the
insurers covering the damage will not exercise subrogation rights
against the party involved in the accident. They will indemnify their
insured subject to the terms of policy. p) The knock for knock agreement

<p>q) The dictionary defines the term ‗knock for knock&rsquo; as an agreement
between auto insurers that in the event of an accident each insurance
company will pay for the damage to the vehicle insured with it, without
attempting to establish blame for the accident. r) The third-party cover
has a limited liability of Rs. 7.5 lakh in case of damage to the vehicle
or property of the third person. s) An International Driving Permit
(IDP) is a permit for use in conjunction with a driving licence, not in
