<h2 id="motor-insurance-claims">MOTOR INSURANCE CLAIMS</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>In this chapter you will learn about the concept of motor insurance claims, motor claims
work-flow procedures and type of losses. You will also learn about the
role of the Surveyor in general and his role in loss minimisation in
motor insurance. Towards the end of the chapter we will focus on the
role of road safety in insurance by insurance industry and frauds in
motor own damage claims and ways to mitigate frauds.</p>

<h2 id="a-motor-insurance-claims">A. Motor Insurance Claims</h2>
<ol>
<li>Doctrine of cause of Accident</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The cause of accident and probable damage caused due to a particular reason is the
most important aspect to be taken into consideration in all motor
claims. There is always a direct relationship between the cause of
accident and damages to the vehicle out of a particular reason and
depends on the transmission of the impact load; jerk load and absorption
of these load waves at different points by the chassis of impact cling
upon the circumstances of accident, intensity and structure of the
vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>A head on collision damage to damper pulley confirms the damages
to crank shaft. Similarly club housing cannot be damaged unless there is
positive displacement of the engine backwardly. A Motor Surveyor can
prepare the list of effected parts / assemblies if he knows the correct
cause of accident. At times actual cause of accident is little different
than that recorded in the claim form by the insured while the estimate
gives some other description. Generally shearing forces do not apply in
the accident and most of the time they are bending forces. It can be
ascertained only on the spot, whether the particular part has suffered a
direct impact or indirect impact. An analytical study of such claim
reveals that the cause of accident is mechanical breakdown in the
vehicle due to sudden shearing off a particular part, which caused the
vehicle to go out of control resulting in damages to vehicle going off
the road. As a matter of fact Motor Insurance Policy does not cover
break down of a part which was the material cause of accident. The
insured fabricate the cause of accident with an intention to cover such
part. Similarly there are cases where shearing off front axle is claimed
in commercial vehicles which took place due to structural failure of the
metal and will be termed as Mechanical Breakdown which is not covered in
the Motor Insurance Policy.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>A car dashed with the rear end of a truck but the damages
claimed were very different than what could have been actually caused.
The damages will be horizontal line damages but during inspection it was
revealed that the damages were caused due to shearing forces applied to
the vehicle along vertical line. The surveyor was at loss to justify the
claim due to the cause of accident given in the claim form. During
discussions insured finally agreed that in fact the accident took place
with an electric pole but with a fear of police case by the electricity
board, insured had not mentioned the actual cause.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Motor Insurance Claims Procedures</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Motor insurance claims due to use of vehicle in public
place involve property damage and bodily injury &amp;/or death caused to
third party including passengers travelling in the vehicle and the
employees engaged in driving, loading and unloading of vehicle as
envisaged in MV Act, 1988 besides damages caused to vehicle resulting in
total and partial loss due to accident or fire and/or theft of the
vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="a-own-damage-claims">a) Own Damage Claims</h2>
<h2 id="diagram-1-own-damage-claims">Diagram 1: Own damage claims</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Motor_insurance_claims_51.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>From the procedural viewpoint claim settlement involves three phases
preliminary scrutiny, assessment of the loss and settlement.</p>
<h2 id="i-preliminary-scrutiny-phase">i. Preliminary Scrutiny Phase</h2>
<p>On receipt of notice of loss, the policy records are checked to verify
that the policy is in force and that it covers the said vehicle involved
in the accident. The loss is entered in the ‗Claims Register‟ and a
‗Claim Form‟ si issued to the insured for completion and return. In case
of commercial vehicles, it is the practice of insurers to arrange for a
survey of the vehicle at the spot of the accident.</p>
<p>This establishes genuineness of the accident and prevents probability of
unwarranted damages and as a consequence excessive claim amounts. The
surveyor usually checks the vehicle, driver&rsquo;s documents, as also load,
carried, if any. The insured is required to submit a detailed estimate
of repairs from any repairer of his choice. Generally, these repairs are
acceptable to the insurer, but at times they may ask the insured to
obtain repair estimate from another repairer, if they have reason to
believe that the competence, moral hazard or business integrity of the
repairer first chosen is not satisfactory.</p>
<h2 id="ii-assessment-phase">ii. Assessment Phase</h2>
<p>Independent automobile surveyors are assigned the task of assessing the
cause and extent of loss where the loss is more than Rs. 20,000/- (as
per insurance Act 1938). They are provided with a copy of the policy,
the claim form and the repairer's estimate. They inspect the damaged
vehicle, discuss the cost of repair or replacement with the repairer and
submit their survey report. In respect of minor damage claims, where the
loss is less than Rs. 20,000/independent surveyors are not necessarily
appointed. The insurers' in house officials or their own automobile
engineers inspect the vehicle and submit an assessment report.</p>
<h2 id="iii-settlement-phase">iii. Settlement Phase</h2>
<p>The survey report is examined and settlement is
effected in accordance with the recommendations contained therein. The
usual practice is to authorise repairs directly with the repairer to
whom a letter is issued to the effect. In this letter of authorization
the repairers are also instructed to collect directly from the insured
the amount of deductible, if applicable to the claim, and also the
amount of depreciation to be borne by the insured, before delivering the
repaired vehicle to him. The repairers are also instructed to keep aside
the salvage of damaged parts, if there are any, for being collected by
the salvage buyer nominated by the insurers. Or else, if the
repairer/insured were willing to retain the salvage, its value, as
indicated by the surveyor, is deducted from the claim bill. On receipt
of final bill after completion of repairs and a satisfaction note or
discharge voucher from the insured that the vehicle has been repaired to
his satisfaction, payment to the repairer is made.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the repairer is paid directly by the insured, in which case
the insured is reimbursed on submission of a receipted bill from the
repairers. In either case, discharge voucher or receipt is obtained. The
Claims Register, the Policy and renewal records are marked that the
claim is paid indicating the amount of claim and the amount of salvage
recovered, if any. Information Technology (IT) has helped improvement in
claim management. Most private insurers have centralised their claim
settlement process with a dedicated call centre team on 24 hours basis.
In the event of a loss the insured is required to telephonically contact
the call centre on the number provided in the policy, and provide the
policy particulars. The details are immediately verified and a claim
number is allotted. The insured is also queried on the details of the
accident and the location of the vehicle at the time of accident. If
towing assistance is required, this is arranged through the approved
towing service provider or repairer.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Claim Documents</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Claim Form: The format and the contents of the claim form differ from insurer to insurer
but the claim form contains questions relating to the following
particulars:</p>
<h2 id="a-the-insured">a) The Insured</h2>
<p>The name of the insured, address,
occupation, policy number, date of payment of last premium to identify
the policy in the insurers' records, and to supplement the preliminary
scrutiny. All the answers on the claim form are verified with the policy
records and discrepancy if any is cleared up as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="b-thevehicle">b) TheVehicle</h2>
<p>The details required in an accident in respect of the vehicle
concerned are, i. Make and year, i . Horse power or cubic capacity, i i.
Registered letters and number, iv. Whether the claimant is the owner of
the vehicle or is it hired to him under a hire purchase agreement, and
is it registered in his name? If not, the full name and address of the
owner has to be given.</p>
<p>It is necessary to make sure that the claimant is registered owner of
the vehicle. In India, motor policies are not allowed to be issued in
any other name except that of a registered owner. If the answer to the
above question is in the negative, it will be necessary to scrutinise
the original proposal form to find out who had proposed for this
insurance. If the claimant himself was the proposer, even though he was
not the registered owner, it will be obvious that the relevant question
in the proposal form was wrongly answered, in which event the contract
will be treated as void and the claim will not be payable. The
information whether any hire purchase company is involved becomes
necessary with a view to ascertaining, whether the claim proceeds in the
event of Total Loss or a loss not reimbursed by payment to the repairers
has to be paid to the hire purchase party, whose name is recorded in the
policy by virtue of Standard endorsement. It may so happen that the
registered owner in whose name the policy has been issued was driving
another car not belonging to him at the time of the accident and the
claim has been lodged for damage to this car or for personal injuries to
a Third Party under the &quot;Driving Other Car&quot; Clause. In India the owner
of the car remains liable for the own damage and third party claim, if
the person driving the accidented vehicle, was doing so with due
permission of the registered owner. In some countries it is necessary to
point out to the claimant that ‗driving others car clause&rsquo; does not
apply to Section I (Damage to Vehicle) of the Policy but to Section II -
(Third Party Section) only. He will, therefore, have to be advised to
ask the registered owner to approach his own insurer for reimbursement
of own damage loss, while the third party claim will be borne by
‗drivers clause&rsquo; in his Motor Insurance.</p>
<h2 id="author-note">Author Note</h2>
<p>In India we do not have any provision of insurance for
―driving other&rsquo;s car‖ liability Insurance. It may cause a peculiar
situation where an uninsured vehicle is driven by a non registered owner
in contravention of the Third party mandatory insurance resulting in
criminal liability on person driving other car for accidental death,
while authorizing to drive an uninsured car remains a civil liability
under MV Act 1988. Even in the Third Party Claims, the Motor Accident
Claims Tribunals in India hold the owner of the car involved in the
accident to be responsible to pay compensation to the injured Third
Parties. Thus, even for a personal injury claim the insurer of the car
will have to be notified and not the insurer of the person who was
driving the car at the material time.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the &quot;Driver Clause&quot; omits any mention that
&quot;the insured may also drive a motor car not belonging to him and not
hired to him under a Hire Purchase Agreement&quot;, as was formerly the
case. For a Commercial vehicle, these additional questions are asked: i.</p>
<p>Registered laden weight .&hellip; unladen weight .&hellip;</p>
<p>i. Nature of goods carried.</p>
<p>i. Was the vehicle loaded to capacity?</p>
<p>iv. What was the weight of goods carried? c) The Use of the Vehicle
There is need to ascertain use of vehicle by posing the following
questions:</p>
<p>i.Please state the exact purpose for which the vehicle was being used at
the time of the accident:</p>
<p>i. Was it being used solely for social, domestic and pleasure</p>
<p>purposes? i i. If the vehicle was being used for business purposes,
please state (a) Upon whose business was it being used? (b) Were goods
being carried? If so, state their nature. (c) Was the vehicle being used
for hire or reward? (d) Were passengers being carried? If so, please
state how many and their relationship to the insured. The purpose of
these questions is to ascertain whether the condition relating to
―Limitation as to Use&quot; was complied with or not. d) The Driver i.</p>
<p>Name of the Driver; Age ............; Address of the
driver.........</p>
<p>i. Is driver (a) Owner (b) Owner's Paid Driver or (c) Owner's relative
or friend?</p>
<p>i. Was he sober and fully competent to drive?</p>

employment of the claimant? x. Have the Police charged the Driver, and
if so, why? All these questions have to be answered. Very few of them
are inapplicable, even if the insured was driving. For example, it is
curious how often the details given in the notice of accident form,
about the duration for which the insured has held a license and the
number of endorsements, differ from the information supplied in the
proposal form. It is important to ascertain the relationship between the
driver and the insured. If the driver happens to be paid driver and if
he is himself injured as result of the accident, it will be necessary to
examine the liability towards him under the Employee's Compensation Act
1923, as provided by the policy. It is also essential that he was sober
and not under the influence of liquor or drugs at the material time.
Otherwise, the own damage claim will not be payable. However, any third
party claim for death / personal injuries only will not be affected in
terms of the clause contained in &quot;General Exceptions&quot; of the policy.
The information in regard to the type of the driving license and its
expiry date will have to tally with the requirements of the &quot;Drivers
Clause&quot; printed on the schedule of the policy. According to this
clause, the person driving must hold a valid and effective driving
license. It must be valid for the particular type of vehicle which met
with an accident.</p>
<p>Example For example, if the license is restricted to drive a Light Motor
Vehicle (L.M.V) the driver is prohibited from driving a Heavy Motor
Vehicle (H.M.V.). Similarly, if the license issued only to drive motor
cycle, it is not valid to for driving a private car.</p>
<p>The &quot;Expiry Date&quot; of license will disclose whether the license was
current at the time of the accident. If the license has already expired,
the Driver Clause provides that the person driving must have held a
license in the past and is not disqualified from obtaining such license.
The important point to be borne in mind in such cases is that the driver
must have had a permanent license in the past and which had expired. If
he had held only a learner's license in the past and which was not
followed by a Permanent License, the claim will not be payable. Even
when the permanent license had expired prior to the date of accident,
the claim will not be settled until the driver applies for and produces
a fresh license.</p>
<p>Definition The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 defines &quot;driving license&quot; as
license issued by a competent authority authorising the person specified
therein to drive, otherwise than as a learner, a motor vehicle of any
specified class or description. Therefore, under the new Motor Vehicles
Act, 1988, a &quot;Learners License&quot; is not considered to be a &quot;Driving
License&quot;. The information regarding the name of the driver assumes
importance when a policy contains a 'Driver Clause' which is amended
to exclude a particular person from driving by adding the words &quot;other
than Mr. / Mrs. &quot; after the words &quot;Any Person&quot;. This practice is
usually followed whenever a proposal for Private Car is received from an
aged person who is not in a position to drive safely, or from a
handicapped person who is unable to drive a car. &quot;Is there any other
Policy indemnifying you or the Driver in respect of this accident?&quot;
This is to ensure that contribution, if applicable, is enforced. i.</p>

Other Documents The other documents required for processing the claim
are:
i. Driving License</p>
<p>i. Registration Certificate Book</p>
<p>i. Fitness Certificate: This applies to Commercial Vehicles. Section 56
of the MV Act 1988 specifically states that the Vehicle registration is
invalid without the ‗Fitness certificate&rsquo;.
iv. Permit
v. Police Report
vi. Final Bill from repairers
vi. Satisfaction Note from the insured
vii. . Receipted bill from the repairer, if paid by insured Technical aspects of, problems involved in
assessment and settlement The exclusions under Section I of the
operative clause of the comprehensive policy lead to several
disagreements between the insured and insurers. a) Own damage claims are
far more than the third party claims. These claims may be of minor
nature (e.g., mere scratching), or of major nature (e.g. head-on
collision or total loss by fire or theft). b) The motor insurance policy
is not a maintenance contract; it is a contract of indemnity. Many a
time, repair or replacement will result in improvement in the vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>For example, the liability under the policy is restricted to
paint of the portion affected by the accident, but the insured would
naturally expect the entire car to be painted to avoid a &quot;patchy
appearance&quot;. In such cases, the insured is expected to contribute
towards the additional cost of repainting the entire car. c) Sometimes
with older vehicles particularly - dismantling of a vehicle reveals
certain defects which are not directly connected with the accident but
still will have to be made good for a satisfactory repair of the whole
vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example</h2>
<p>For example, the effect of rust is revealed only after
dismantling and will have to be rectified before a new part is fitted.
These costs are in the nature of maintenance expenses and the insured
will have to bear the costs of these incidental repairs which are not
directly related to the accident. d) Another area of misunderstanding
between the insured and insurers is that of depreciation charged when
old parts are replaced by new ones. Here again, the insured is expected
to bear a certain part of the cost. This is based on the principle of
indemnity whereby the insured must neither benefit by the accident nor
be left to suffer. This is implied not by any specific condition in the
policy but by the operative clause itself which reads &quot;The Company will
indemnify the insured against loss etc.&quot; The rate of depreciation
varies according to the type of part replaced, the age of the vehicle
and its general maintenance. The rate of depreciation is highest for
rubber parts, whereas no depreciation is applied when windscreen glass
is replaced. Depreciation ranging from 25% to 30% is charged on
replacement of 'cabin and body' of a public carrier, because wood is
subject to weather conditions and fatigue and the joints of cabin would
be loosened due to operating conditions such as uneven loading, bad road
conditions, high speed, overloading, etc. Therefore, insurers endeavor
to ensure, especially with older vehicles, that damage caused by general
deterioration of body work is not claimed for as accidental damage. The
edges of body panels become rusted or corroded in the course of time.</p>
<p>Example For example, sea water has a highly corroding effect upon metal.
When accidental damage repairs are carried out, some wear and tear too
will have to be made good. The principle of indemnity demands that the
insured must contribute to the cost. When damaged parts are replaced by
new, an allowance is sought from the repairers towards the value of
salvage. Alternatively, old parts are recovered and sold as scrap or if
of no economic value salvage is destroyed. The standard Package Policy
makes express provision concerning deduction for depreciation at the
rates, mentioned in the policy, in respect of parts replaced. As
depreciation applicable is now expressly spelt out in the Policy Form,
this area of misunderstanding is removed for all Vehicles. e)
Differences also arise on the question of repair or replacement and it
may be more profitable for the repairer to replace a new part than to
repair an old one. If the part is repairable and the safety of the
vehicle is not impaired, then the repair is insisted upon. The work is
entrusted to competent repairer or to makers or to a firm of
specialists. A good deal of specialisation has crept in motor repair
work. There are specialist firms for welding, repair or replacement of
chassis frames, radiators, coach work, painting etc.</p>

<p>Which of the following statement is correct? I.</p>
<p>In every case, independent automobile surveyors are assigned the task of
assessing the cause and extent of loss irrespective of the amount of
loss. II. Independent automobile surveyors are assigned the task of
assessing the cause and extent of loss where the loss is more than Rs.

appoint an independent automobile surveyor to assess the cause and
extent of loss where the loss is more than Rs. 20,000/-. IV. The insurer
and insured independently appoint their own automobile surveyor to
assess the cause and extent of loss where the loss is more than Rs.

mutualy agree to the loss amount to be paid</p>
<h2 id="b-types-of-losses">B. Types of Losses</h2>
<ol>
<li>Types of Losses The different types of losses
include the following: a) Total Loss or Constructive Total Loss A
vehicle is treated as total loss mainly when it is considered that
economical repairs are not possible. Whenever a surveyor finds that a
vehicle is either beyond repairs or the cost of repair exceeds 75% of
the IDV; he assesses the claim on a Constructive Total Loss basis (CTL).
However, before releasing the actual payment to the insured, the
insurers collect i. Registration book and Taxation receipt, ii. Ignition
keys in duplicate and iii. Blank TO and T.T.O. forms duly signed by the
insured The above documents are collected so that salvage can be
transferred in the name of the salvage buyer. If the vehicle is beyond
repairs and has to be scrapped the R.C. Book and the keys will have to
be returned to the Registering Authority for cancellation. For computing
Total loss value of a vehicle on the date of loss, we need to work out:
i. Depreciated cost of chassis (x) by deducting cost of all five new
tyres (including stepny) from replacement value of the vehicle having
same specification and make as on date of loss by applying depreciation
on chassis as applicable and adding back 50% cost of tyres. i .
Thereafter depreciated value of Body (Y) is worked out on applicable
higher deprecation due to wood work / upholstery etc. on the cost of
body fabrication. Total loss without salvage = [X+Y &ndash; Excess clause]
The salvage is collected by insurer and disposed off later to reduce
their claims out go. The fair value of salvage on ―as is where is basis‖
is the difference of expected value of the damaged vehicle after
necessary repairs and replacement [X] (this value is the fair market
resale price after arranging necessary repairs and replacements) from
the estimated value of parts and labour for replacement, to bring the
vehicle in roadworthy condition [Y] (after considering depreciated
values) Fair value of salvage [S] = [X] - [Y] IC-72 MOTOR
INSURANCE</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="b-total-loss-due-to-theft">b) Total Loss due to Theft</h2>
<p>Total loss can also arise due to theft of
the vehicle remaining untraced by the police authorities. This loss due
to theft will have to be supported by a copy of the First Information
Report (FIR) lodged with the Police authorities immediately after the
theft has been detected. The Police authorities register complaint
allotting it a number of the entry made in the Station Diary. This
number, which is usually known as SDE (Station Diary entry) No. or C.R.
No. (Crime Register) has to be quoted by the insured in the claim
intimation to the insurers. An assessor may be called to investigate the
theft of a vehicle and to negotiate a settlement (where IDV is not
applicable) with the insured in the event of the vehicle not being
recovered. It is necessary to ascertain following information from the
insured: i.</p>
<p>Detailed circumstances surrounding the event</p>
<p>i . Time &amp; place of leaving the vehicle and time of discovering loss i
i. When Police was informed? iv. Details given in FIR lodged with Police
v. Full details of vehicle and log book if any maintained vi. Date of
purchase of vehicle vi . Price originally paid vii. . Any major items of
expenditure which might have brought the condition of the vehicle above
average ix. Manufacturers price list on the date of loss It is usual for
insurers to wait for at least a month after the vehicle was stolen. The
police keep the investigations on until the vehicle is traced and
delivered to its owner. However, if they do not succeed in recovering
the vehicle after a period of 90 days, they file away the claim,
certifying that the theft of vehicle is classified as true but
untraceable. This untraced Certificate is essential before a Total loss
claim following theft of vehicle is settled by the insurers. The
documents to be submitted by the insured will be the same as those
described above. If the R.C. book and Taxation Certificate are also
stolen along with the vehicle, it will be necessary for the insured to
obtain duplicate ones from the Registering Transport Authority and
thereafter to be deposited with the insurers.</p>
<p>The only additional documents will be a letter addressed by the insured
to the R.T.A. informing about the loss of the vehicle due to theft and
filling of a Non-Use Form so that he is not made liable to pay the
taxes. Some insurers also obtain from the insured an ‗indemnity bond'
which is special type of discharge on a stamped paper, whereby the
insured undertakes to refund the claim amount, if the vehicle is
subsequently traced and delivered to him by the police. He also
undertakes in the Discharge Form to pay any taxes which may be
outstanding against the stolen vehicle. The ignition keys, R.C. Book
etc. are kept in safe custody by the insurer so that these are made
readily available if the vehicle is traced at a later date. It is always
prudent to inform the concerned Registering transport Authority by a
Registered A/D post, that a Total loss claim is being processed for
payment in respect of the stolen vehicle and to request them not to
transfer the ownership of the vehicle to anyone. This will prevent a
thief from disposing off the stolen vehicle. Again, there have been
occasions, when the Registering Authorities have informed the insurers
in reply that the vehicle has not been registered by them or that the
vehicle is already plying in someone else's name. This has exposed the
frauds perpetrated by certain gangs insuring non-existing vehicles. The
IDV is the liability payable in the event of a Total Loss, whether due
to a Theft or Total Loss. It is defined in the Policy and this is the
ultimate liability payable by the insurers in such circumstances.</p>
<p>Example A scooter insured for Rs. 15,000/- met with a serious accident.
The net repair liability is Rs. 12,000/-. The salvage value of the
damaged scooter is Rs. 5,000/. Calculate the net liability of the
Insurance Company. Answer Since repairing liability is more than 75%,
the claim is to be treated as Constructive Total Loss and liability of
the Insurance Company would be: IDV Less Salvage Less Excess Net
liability</p>
<p>Rs. 15,000 Rs. 5,000 Rs. 50 Rs. 9,950 &ndash; subject to cancellation of
policy</p>
<h2 id="c-recovery-of-stolen-vehicles">c) Recovery of Stolen Vehicles</h2>
<p>Claims on repair basis also arise when
the stolen vehicles are recovered in damaged condition and / or stripped
of some parts. In such cases, the procedure followed is the same as in
the case of accidental repairs, except that spot survey is always
essential as soon as the vehicle is brought in the police premises. If
this is not done and if the insured is allowed to remove it directly to
the repairer's garage for final survey, it is most likely that some
more items will be found missing at the time of final survey.</p>
<p>Example A private Maruti Swift 2005 model insured for Rs. 3 lacs from
1.4.2009 to 31.3.2010 met with an accident on 15.1.2010. The surveyor
has assessed the loss as under: Labour charges Painting charges Cost of
Radiator Cost of Head Lights Cost of Wind Screen Cost of Grill Cost of
Bumper Salvage value of parts</p>
<p>Rs. 15,000 Rs. 10,000 Rs. 7,000 less Salvage Rs. 3,000 Rs. 4,000 Rs.
2,000 Rs. 6,000 Rs. 100</p>
<p>Calculate the net liability Answer Labour + Painting Cost of Head Lights
Cost of Radiator Cost of Wind Screen Cost of Grill / Bumper Less Salvage

<p>210</p>
<p>Rs. 25,000 Rs. 3,000 Nil Depreciation Rs. 7,000 Less Depreciation 35%
(parts 4 years to 5 years) = Rs. 4,875 Rs. 4,000 Nil Depreciation Rs.
8,000 Less 50% Deprecation being plastic parts = Rs. 4,000 Rs. 100 Rs.
500 Rs. 40,274</p>
<h2 id="assessment-on-repair-basis">Assessment on Repair Basis</h2>
<p>While calculating the loss on repair basis,
the estimates submitted by the insured consists of three heads: i.</p>
<p>List of parts claimed for replacement.</p>
<p>i . General repairs and labour charges ii. . Cabin / Body / Show
repairing and labour charges Insured is allowed to opt for his repairer
so that vehicle is repaired to his entire satisfaction and repairer is
required to attend repairs properly as recommended by Surveyor. The
settlement on repair basis is subject to suitable depreciation on
mechanical parts on the basis of year of manufacture and on rubber /
plastic and fiber parts. Similarly labour charges include charges for
dismantling of various assemblies, replacing new parts and for repairing
of mechanical assemblies which includes refitting / repairing /
reconditioning e.g., realigning of Front axle, Chassis, Wheel repairing,
Suspension leaves re-cambering /resetting, Seats repairing etc. Finally
the repair charges for dent removal and painting are also taken into
consideration. The principle of contribution is applicable while
finalising assessment to comply the requirement of indemnity. All the
damaged parts (salvage items) for which replacements are allowed becomes
the property of insurer. The settlement on repair basis is subject to
suitable depreciation and principle of contribution to applicable for
the requirement of indemnity. In the case of Commercial Vehicles,
particularly when Goods carrying vehicles meet with serious accident in
remote parts on the highway; it is usual practice for insurers to
arrange for what is known as a &quot;Spot Survey&quot;. This consists of
inspecting the vehicle at the site of the accident in „as is, where is‟
condition and noting down the damages sustained by it. The final survey
is carried out when the vehicle is brought to the repairer's garage.
The spot surveys help to establish the extent of damage caused by the
accident, so that it is not exaggerated by the claimant after the
vehicle reaches the place of repair.</p>
<h2 id="d-cash-loss-net-of-salvage-or-cash-less-settlement">d) Cash loss (Net of salvage or cash less) Settlement</h2>
<p>When a claim is settled on repair basis, the
payment is made either direct to the repairers against his bills / cash
memos or to the insured on production of receipted bill of the repairer.
Wherever a claim is settled on Total Loss basis, the salvage becomes the
property of the insurer.</p>
<p>However, under certain circumstances, insurers settle Total Loss claims
without claiming the salvage (Net of salvage basis) or reimburse the
insured with his repairs bills without submission of repairs bill or
without even verifying whether the vehicle is or will be repaired or not
(cash Loss basis). These types of settlements are in the nature of
compromise mode of settlements and are known as &quot;Cash Loss&quot;
settlements, which are usually resorted to in the case of Commercial
Vehicle claims payable on 'repairs' basis.</p>
<h2 id="e-cash-loss-settlement">e) Cash loss settlement</h2>
<p>By their very nature, repairs to a vehicle have to be carried out by
different workshops depending on whether it is tin-work, body-work or
mechanical work, etc. The owner of a vehicle is in no position to
finance the entire job himself, especially when the outlay is large and
has to wait for reimbursement from the insurers, after the complete job
has been carried out and verified by the surveyor. In such a situation,
both the parties to the insurance contract come to an arrangement,
whereby the insured agrees to accept a sum which is lower than the
assessed amount by, say 25% to 30% and the insurer agrees to pay it in
cash without insisting that the repairs will be carried out. In fact,
the insured is free to do what he wishes with the vehicle, e.g. he can
even sell the vehicle in &quot;as is, where is&quot; condition. The cut in the
assessed amount is supposed to take care of this possibility and / or to
represent the expenses such as sales tax, excise etc., which the insured
may not have to incur if he chooses to repair the vehicle by fixing up
second-hand spare parts. This mode of settlement is also adopted when
the claim is assessed for Total loss. But difficulties are encountered
in disposing of the salvage or when a reasonable amount is not
forthcoming as value of the salvage. In such cases, the value of the
salvage is mutually agreed upon, as recommended by the surveyor, and
this is deducted from the amount of Total Loss as assessed by the
insured. In other words, the insured is reimbursed on Net of salvage on
Total Loss basis and allowed to retain the salvage. i. When the insured
insists on repairs even though Total Loss settlement adjusting the
salvage value available is more economical to the insurer. In such
circumstances, a 'Cash Loss' amount representing the ‗Net Total Loss'
is reimbursed to the insured, allowing him to get repairs at his own
cost. i . When the insured purchases spare parts but he is not in a
position to hand over purchase bills, these losses are settled as ―Cash
Losses&quot; without insisting on bills for an amount which is suitably
scaled down.</p>
<h2 id="f-cash-less-settlement">f) Cash less settlement</h2>
<p>Most insurers have entered into agreement with
a host of repairers including authorised repairers of the manufacturers
to repair the insured vehicles claim by charging inadmissible costs only
and the admissible claim costs are directly paid by Insurance Company
directly to the repairer. These are termed as Preferred Garages. This
facility is offered to private car insured&rsquo;s only. Customers opting for
repairs at these preferred garages are required to drive or tow the
vehicle to the garage. All claim formalities like completion of claim
form, submission of vehicle documents are immediately completed by
garages. The surveyor is sent by the insurer to the garage for
assessment of the loss. Once the vehicle is repaired the insured is
informed to collect the vehicle and pay the difference in charges i.e.,
the inadmissible cost of repairs like depreciation, deductible and other
unrelated charges. The rest of the payment is made directly by the
insurers to the garage.</p>

<li>Various Causes of Accident</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-fire-damage-to-vehicle">a) Fire Damage to Vehicle</h2>
<p>Damage to vehicle due to fire needs a good deal of care in
investigation to ascertain, if possible, the origin of fire. The most
usual cause of motor vehicle fires is the failure of electrical system
and these most frequently follows repairs which have involved removal of
the engine at some point of time. This usually causes the wiring to be
disturbed which breaks down the insulation and results in a fire perhaps
months later. The reconstruction and repair of vehicles seriously
damaged by fire is an extremely difficult proposition and unless there
is a very big margin between the cost of repairs and writing off the
vehicle, it frequently proves more economical to deal with the claim on
a Total loss or Cash in lieu of loss.</p>
<h2 id="b-loss-caused-by-mechanical--electrical-break-down">b) Loss caused by Mechanical / Electrical Break Down</h2>
<p>Loss caused by Mechanical / Electrical Break Down
are excluded from the policy cover, but any damage consequent thereon
would normally be the subject of indemnity. Generally mechanical
breakdown will be deemed to be confined to actual unit in which the
initial failure took place thus, if a connecting rod big end bolt
fractured with the result that the connecting rod came out through the
side of the crank case, this would be regarded as a mechanical breakdown
of the engine and the whole of the damage be excluded.</p>
<p>On the other hand if a fan blade broke and went through the radiator the
fan blade would be excluded as mechanical breakdown but consequential
damage caused to the radiator would be subject of indemnity under the
policy.</p>
<h2 id="c-loss-caused-by-frost">c) Loss caused by Frost</h2>
<p>Most insurance policies cover frost
subject to suitable precaution having been taken as specifically laid
down by underwriters&rsquo; and include either: i. The correct quantity of
anti-freezing mixtures to be added to the water in the cooling system
and regularly maintained at correct proportion or ii. The cooling system
is to be entirely drained. The surveyor is required to differentiate
between frost damage and crack near the top face of the block which can
be productively repaired by electrode deposition without any dismantling
of the engine unit as the process is cold one. If it is necessary to fit
a new cylinder block the question of depreciation has to be considered.</p>
<h2 id="d-loss-of-use-of-vehicle">d) Loss of Use of Vehicle</h2>
<p>Where the claim is made for hiring similar
replacement vehicle we must take into account an allowance to be
deducted from the normal hiring charges to represent the saving of
running costs which would have been incurred had the owners own vehicle
would have been used.</p>
<h2 id="e-manhole-cover-stolen">e) Manhole Cover Stolen</h2>
<p>This is a menace which results in damage to vehicle and at time even bodily injury or loss of
life in some circumstances. Such motor accidents are covered by the
Motor Insurance Policy. However, the right of recovery is subrogated to
insurance company from the person liable to maintain. Municipal
Authorities who are liable for upkeep and maintenance of such property
are legally liable under Common Law for loss or damage caused to any
person using the road in public place.</p>
<h2 id="f-auto-crashes---multiple-cars-crash">f) Auto Crashes - Multiple Cars Crash</h2>
<p>The high speeds in Automobiles being current craze have brought in
the probability of multiple car crashes due to one vehicle meeting with
an accident either due to collision or overturning or a policeman
stopping a vehicle for check all of a sudden or fog obscuring the
visibility of driver in winter season. Such accidents may increase the
liabilities many folds and are fit to be reinsured.</p>
<h2 id="g-vehicle-lying-in-garage-or-valet-parking">g) Vehicle Lying in Garage or Valet Parking</h2>
<p>Fire or accident to a
vehicle during repairs at garage: It has been noted that the vehicles
lying with dealers or repairers garages at time meet with accident
either by the repairers&rsquo; mechanics driving the vehicle, even when the
mechanic is just dropping the owner after the vehicle has been handed
over for repairs. The garage owner becomes legally liable due to the
fact that he has taken vehicle as, goods in trust, for repair work. Even
a vehicle parked in a garage overnight will also cause the liability to
be on garage owner. The Motor Insurance Policy does not cover liability
of garage owner and the owner of the vehicle has a right to recover
damages if any contributed by garage owners or his employees whilst the
vehicle is lying in garage or used , tested by garage workers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Salvage / Scrap Disposal</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The word salvage means the things that are
saved from a disaster or accident. However, in insurance claims salvage
is used to denote damaged parts for which replacements have been allowed
as the damaged part cannot be repaired i.e., cannot be salvaged. This is

<li>Accident Repairing Cost</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Although third party losses are less
controllable, but motor damage losses may be contained to a large
extent, if leakage during vehicle repairs in regard to over-pricing of
spare parts, inclusion of obligatory parts, over-charging of labour cost
or replacement of repairable parts are closely monitored. Further at
times, repairs lead to lesser efficiency of the vehicle and greater
proneness to serious accidents due to inappropriate facilities available
with garages undertaking repairs as compared to manufacturers. The
following factors are assessed for Post Automotive Repair: i.</p>
<p>Labour charges /Time schedule &amp; Rate</p>
<p>i . Painting component / Technology used in painting i i. Spare parts
pricing Manufacturer&rsquo;s / Dealers&rsquo; current strategy is to earn profits
through accident repair jobs at the insured&rsquo;s cost. Over charging to
insurers need to be eliminated by replacing the current ‗live and let
die&rsquo; policy of manufacturers and Dealers by ‗live and let live'
approach. We need to identify accident prone parts, claim prone parts
and spare parts price revision pattern, repair cost basis, including PML
concept to keep a check on claim cost.</p>
<p>The Insurance Companies or General Insurance Council of India the
representative body of Insurers must initiate i.</p>
<p>Dialogue with manufacturers on all above mentioned factors</p>
<p>i. Under take Studies for various models design; positional structure of
accident prone parts, electronic parts, turbo etc.</p>
<p>i.Identify standard of accident repairing facilities at various garages
and</p>
<p>iv. Evaluate competence of the dealers handling repairs of body parts,
frames, axles etc. a) Repair techniques There are various steps in
repairing automobiles:</p>
<p>i.Welding: Welding is of two types a. Hot welding and b. Cold welding</p>
<p>i. Glass and plastic repairs; Glass cracks and plastic cracks can now be
removed by various technologies thus reducing the cost of replacement.</p>
<p>i.Denting is possible for fiber parts as well.</p>
<p>iv. Denting / body works: These are generally out sourced to small
roadside denters or generally unqualified persons. Denting is also
slowly moving towards technology driven affair, where the dents are
removed by creating vacuum to keep the tensile strength of body parts
intact. v. Painting: Painting is by various methods which have different
costs involved (a) Brush painting (b) Hot painting (c) Dip painting vi.
Windshield repair loss minimisation in motor is also common now. In
India according to a survey, glass damages, specifically windshields,
contribute to over 200-300 Crores (approximately) every year to the
insurance industry as a whole. Almost all damaged windshields are
replaced; even the ones with small or minor damages like Bull&rsquo;s eye at
the cost of insurance companies, simply because of ignorance of
possibility of repairs, thereby, rendering glass manufacturers as
ultimate beneficiary.</p>
<p>The advance repair facilities for glass repairs are available in India
but the same is being discouraged by the vested interest, leaving
insurance industry to withstand losses to the tune of several crores.
Damages even the ones running up to 3 feet cracks though repairable are
being recommended to be replaced. The industry can save several hundred
crores, if only replaceable windshields and fixed glasses are replaced
and not the repairable ones. It is heartening to note that damages
ranging from small dings, bull&rsquo;s eye, star breaks, combination breaks
and even the long and multiple cracks can be repaired at a cost as low
as 8 to 10 % cost of new or replacement that too in merely 20-30 minutes
at the door step of the customer.</p>
<h2 id="b-importance-of-windscreen-repairs-and-its-benefits">b) Importance of Windscreen Repairs and its Benefits</h2>
<p>The (laminated) windscreen of the vehicles once
damaged, had to be replaced. At times the vehicle is being driven in the
damaged state to avoid going for claim by the consumer, endangering the
lives of the occupants, general public, as the vehicle with the damaged
windscreen interferes in the vision of the driver, and also compromises
on the strength of the vehicle. The prevalent practice of Windscreen
replacement proves to be expensive and time-consuming option. The cost
of windscreen repairs is less than 10% of the cost of new windscreen or
windscreen replacement. The damages to the windscreen in more than 85%
cases are small dings or cracks, when left unattended these escalate
into large and multiple cracks. Without protection these damages tend to
increase as they get infected with dirt, mud and dust particles along
with water. Though water evaporates, the foreign material settles down
in the damage, making the damage unrepairable. Hence it is important to
secure the damage at the time of impact itself, through tapes stickers
provided by glass repairers. It is studied that the original Factory
fitted windscreen provides 22% strength to the car, when it is replaced
it loses the company seal carried out through machines by applying
pressure from all sides of the vehicle at the time of manufacturing
making it an integral part of the car. The obvious inference is that the
windscreen replacement outside manufacturing facilities compromises the
safety of the car and its occupants and the general public at large who
might be exposed to any untoward mishap. The Factory fitted windscreen
provides strength to the vehicle in case of an accident and rollover,
when it helps in preventing the roof of the car to cave in / crush. The
replaced screen tends to pop out in case of an accident defeating one of
the main purposes of windscreen installation at manufacturers end.</p>
<p>Further windscreen forms an integral part in the operation of passenger
side Air Bag in the cars. In case of an accident the passenger side air
bag exerts pressure on the windscreen to operate and come out towards
the passenger. If the windscreen is a replaced one, the air bag fails to
operate, as the windscreen tends to pop out of the car leaving the
passenger to greater risk. In several countries windscreen repairs are
qualified for no claim bonus to give boost to safety of the car and
passengers in case of later accidents.</p>

<ol start="7">
<li>Science of Damage Estimation and the Technology Support</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Insurance claims estimating system are available for vehicle
damage estimation which can be used by Surveyors and Repair garages to
obtain information about spare parts, labour charges and repair
operations for automobile repairs that enables an insurance surveyour to
quickly and accurately estimate damage to various parts of a vehicle.
Computerised insurance estimating systems are known which provide access
to large amounts of parts information such as: i. Parts prices, i .
Availability of parts, i i. Labour estimates and iv. Replacement
operations Furthermore various systems for storing and retrieving texts
and associated data and graphics are also known.</p>
<p>Example The text menus and graphics have been stored in computer memory
and displayed in separate windows on screen. Controls have also been
provided to scroll windows up and down, left and right to thereby
display different portions of texts menus and graphics. 218</p>
<p>The insurance claims estimation methods allow the Surveyour to analyse
damage to various ‗layers&rsquo; of a vehicle. If damage to an ‗outer layer'
of a vehicle is visible, the insurance estimator will quickly perform a
damage estimate using the catastrophe or drill in and drill out
features. Nevertheless, the estimator will be reminded to also look for
damage in ‗lower layers&rsquo; of the vehicle that are not readily visible.
Conversely, a Surveyour may begin estimating damage to a vehicle by
focusing on the interior of a vehicle which has significant interior
damage. The method then reminds the Surveyour not to overlook slight
damage to outer layers of the vehicle. The catastrophe feature of the
method permits insurance Surveyours to quickly and accurately perform a
large number of damage estimates, when damage is primarily to outer
layer of the vehicle, such as damage resulting from hail, sand, or wood.
The invention allows an insurance Surveyour to select a desired vehicle
part for repair, replacement, or other operations, in a number of quick
and convenient ways, and gives the Surveyour a number of options. The
invention also prevents &ldquo;double charging&rdquo; when there is a possibility
that a vehicle part may be selected more than once.</p>

<h2 id="c-surveyor-and-his-role-in-loss-minimisation">C. Surveyor and His role in Loss Minimisation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Role of Surveyor</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>It is regrettable that it has become tedious for getting claims settled by
insurance companies for accidents covered under the Motor Insurance
policy. The most plausible reason is the dependence of insurance
companies on Surveyors. The Surveyors are independent licensed
professionals, but they have to depend on insurance companies for
allocation of survey work and are paid their survey fees by insurers.
This has rendered them predisposed in fulfilling insurance company&rsquo;s
objectives of paying genuine claims and in this process have developed a
distrusting approach towards claimants. They feel that they are doing a
favour to the assured in recommending settlement of their claims. This
approach needs to be altered. The insurance contract is a contract of
utmost good faith on the part of both insured and insurer including the
agencies supporting it. The very purpose of insurance company&rsquo;s service
is to ―pay claims, if any, and repudiate, only if it is a must‖.</p>
<p>SURVEYOR AND HIS ROLE IN LOSS MINIMISATION</p>
<p>Therefore, reliability, dependability and courtesy of the Surveyor along
with his knowledge, expertise of the subject should be the main criteria
for enrolling a surveyor in a company&rsquo;s panel. Insurance Surveyors and
Loss assessors (Licencing, Professional Requirements and Code of Conduct
Regulations) 2000 Chapter VI gives code of conduct viz. i.</p>
<p>To behave ethically and with integrity implying fairness and
truthfulness,</p>
<p>i . Strive for objectivity, ii. . Carry out his work with due diligence,
care and skill, iv. Keep him up dated, and v. Provide free professional
training These statutory obligations render Surveyors accountable for
their professional work and cannot afford to make a mistake and go with
impunity. Approach of the insurers&rsquo; on survey / Surveyors is that of
trust and their expectation from Surveyor can be summarised as - ―allow
repairs, replacement as if the vehicle is yours; assess the claim as if
money is yours.‖ This requirement from a Surveyor expects immediate
Survey, dedication to the profession, reporting without delay and fair
deal with all concerned. Surveyor&rsquo;s work is, therefore, directly
affected by IRDA&rsquo;s regulations and the approach of the insurers on
survey / Surveyors and finally their personal qualities and technical
qualifications.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Steps in Motor Survey</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Two important steps in motorsurvey are</p>
<h2 id="a-human-relationship">a) Human Relationship</h2>
<p>Human relationship is the most overlooked factor. Although
the field of work covered is automobile assessing, it comprises basic
principles of engineering. Technical ability is of prime importance,
besides natural flair for work and experience. The automobile assessor
is normally holding the scales between the interest of his principals,
the insured and the repairer. The qualities of a Surveyor which go to
make a first class professional are especially his attitude and
relationship with the insured, insurer and repairer. Some of the
qualities are as hereunder: Absolute integrity which will need the
Surveyors to have his Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts in tune with accepted norms:</p>
<p>i . Fair mindedness - in assessing the loss ii. . Tact and ability &ndash; in
handling relations</p>
<h2 id="b-surveying-ability">b) Surveying Ability</h2>
<p>The surveying relates to thorough practical engineering training with a high standard of
technical knowledge, knowledge of cost of repairs, extreme thoroughness
and capacity for hard work. Surveying is required for</p>
<p>Valuation of vehicle, Spot Survey, Preliminary Survey Final Survey and
Re-inspection Surveys</p>
<h2 id="i-technical-knowledge">i. Technical Knowledge</h2>
<p>The assessment is not an accounting activity but the result of a
technical knowhow ensuring that the repair charges assessed by the
Surveyour will be sufficient to bring back the vehicle to pre-accident
condition. He must check all the suspected parts, authorise necessary
dismantling and clearly explain the difference between dismounting and
dismantling. A careless assessment combined with an inexperienced
repairer may culminate into a major accident due to un-rectified
defects.</p>
<h2 id="ii-cost-of-repairs">ii. Cost of repairs</h2>
<p>The other aspect of assessment is determining cost of repairs which are based on following two systems:
(a) Time Basis or man hour basis more suited to manufacturers though
some manufacturers of motor vehicle give a schedule of man hours
required for each job and within certain limits the correct man hours
can be fixed in advance. But this basis of assessment is most abused.
(b) Job basis or contract basis is based on piece rates are fixed on the
basis on past experience of the time and material taken in completing
similar jobs.</p>
<h2 id="iii-extreme-thoroughness">iii. Extreme thoroughness</h2>
<p>The thoroughness is mainly required in
checking internal parts to avoid a supplementary estimate with a list of
internal parts due to an array of broken parts being exhibited by
repairer in the next visit. The Surveyor must permit an opportunity to
repairers to dismantle assemblies in his presence to rule out
unnecessary liabilities and avoid dissatisfaction of insured.</p>
<h2 id="iv-capacity-for-hard-work">iv. Capacity for hard work</h2>
<p>The Surveyour&rsquo;s work has no time schedule, and
the assessor is required to travel and work according to the
availability. He is required to spend long hours on site of repairs
which have a telling effect on his health.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Guidelines on Automobile Survey</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Motor surveyor requires good technical knowledge about
repairability, prevailing market conditions, availability of spares,
cost of repairs, and an ability to convince repairer and insured and
take spot decisions. Wherever, a surveyor has to be appointed for
assessing a loss / claim, it shall be so done within 72 hours of the
receipt of intimation from the insured. A surveyor is requested orally
or through mail which he is required to acknowledge and confirm his
acceptance and inform the insured when he shall conduct the survey. At
the time of accepting a survey, unless it is a spot survey, the surveyor
is to be provided a copy of Claim Form to ascertain date of registration
and Cause of accident and Estimate of repairs to decide mode of
settlement. The survey report is to be submitted promptly, even subject
to verification of RC / DL / Permit / load Challan etc., by the insurer
if not available at the time of survey. Verification / attestation by
the surveyor or insurer have to be done on production of original
documents without believing photo copies which can be easily
manipulated. This will save the complaints of non-performing survey or
submission of manipulated photos made available by insured. Other
details to be noted / recorded are: i.</p>
<p>Identity of the subject matter</p>
<p>i . Cause of accident ii. . Nature and extent of damage iv. Third party
damage &ndash; persons &amp; property v. Photos vi. Identity of the subject
matter</p>

assemblies ix. Make &amp; Model, x. Type of Body, Colour of the vehicle xi.
Class of vehicle, xi . Type of goods carried/ weight of goods ,
Weighment slip, Trip sheet xi i. Odometer reading</p>
<h2 id="a-pre-accident-condition-of-the-vehicle">a) Pre-accident Condition of the Vehicle</h2>
<p>In Motor Insurance there is no pre-insurance
inspection, except when fixing IDV for vehicles more than five year old
or if a total loss vehicle is to be insured, or if there is a break in
insurance before successive renewal. This is mainly for valuation of the
vehicle for TL / CTL and theft risk or for establishing state of
repairs. Generally when a claim is preferred by the insured, insurer
gets a chance to inspect the vehicle. Therefore, Surveyor is required to
give a detailed report of pre-accident condition of the vehicle. This
will enable insurer to form an accurate impression about the condition,
value and road worthiness of the vehicle insured by them. It is
sometimes revealed that the vehicle was not maintained in an „efficient
condition‟ i.e., vehicle was not found road worthy. Since this is a
breach of a condition of the policy, the claim may not be admitted. The
loss or damage to a vehicle may be caused due to wear and tear e.g.,
loose steering wheel, shoeless brakes, bald tyres&rsquo; or tyres devoid of
tread.</p>
<h2 id="b-cause-of-accident">b) Cause of Accident</h2>
<p>The cause of accident is determined by
obtaining drivers/ occupants, statement giving cause and nature of
accident along with the address and phone numbers. Surveyor should form
his opinion befitting of the circumstances and concurrent with driver
and occupants&rsquo; version.</p>
<h2 id="c-nature-and-extent-of-damage">c) Nature and Extent of Damage</h2>
<p>All vehicular
damages, marks on the vehicle, reporting available oil in various
assemblies in case of Fire accident, type of failure / breakage if any;
list of missing parts, hanging parts or parts removed and list of parts
which could not be examined due to their peculiar location must be
given. The surveyor need not list suspected parts or parts to be
checked.</p>
<h2 id="d-third-party-damage">d) Third Party Damage</h2>
<p>Surveyor must obtain:</p>
<p>i.Details of persons involved in the accident,</p>
<p>i . Property damaged and third party vehicle involved if any; i i. Total
number of occupants with available details; iv. Nearby hospitals where
accident victims were admitted /discharged; v. Sketch of accident site
with reference to accident site identification like mile stone,
culverts, bridges etc., covering from the point of view of impact to its
final position showing tyre or any other marks; vi. Copy of FIR</p>
<h2 id="e-photos">e) Photos</h2>
<p>The photos must be by a digital camera imprinting date and time
of survey and signed on the back, duly highlighting with necessary
description. Similarly pencil traces of engine chassis number must be
verified with plate affixed on the vehicle and Registration book, permit
(if commercial vehicle), explosive licence (if hazardous goods carrying
vehicle) etc., especially mentioning the fact in the report. The
surveyor is required to instruct the insured to remove the vehicle to a
place of safety without delay to avoid theft of parts. The surveyor
shall be subjected to the code of conduct laid down by the authority
while assessing the loss, and shall communicate his findings to the
insurer within 30 days of his appointment with a copy of the report
being furnished to the insured, if he so desires. Where, in special
circumstances of the case, either due to its special and complicated
nature, the surveyor shall under intimation to the insured, seek an
extension from the insurer for submission of his report. In no case
shall a surveyor take more than 6 months from the date of his
appointment to finfish his report. If an insurer finds it incomplete in
any respect, or wants any clarification he shall require the surveyor
under intimation to the insured, to furnish an additional report on
those specific issues. This facility of calling for an additional report
by the insurer shall not be resorted to more than once in the case of a
claim. Such a request may be made by the insurer within 15 days of the
receipt of original survey report. The surveyor on receipt of this
communication shall furnish an additional report within 3 weeks of the
date of receipt of communication from the insurer.</p>
<p>f) Spot Survey</p>
<p>The main purpose is to
i.Reduce opportunity of moral hazard</p>
<p>i. Establish actual cause and nature of accident,</p>
<p>i. Register actual damage to the vehicle without allowing room for
tempering,</p>
<p>iv. Take spot decision on major damages, v. Facilitate removal to
workshop, dismounting / dismantling needed and repairs at the spot vi.
Check substitution of parts like radiator, stub axles, steering
assembly, batteries and sometimes even front axle, I Beam etc., vi .
Verify third party involvement in respect of bodily injury or property
damage or other vehicles involvement.</p>
<h2 id="g-final-survey">g) Final Survey</h2>
<p>Final survey is accepted on receipt of Claim form and Estimate of repairs and insurers
are to be informed if the spot survey has been conducted. The surveyor
while inspecting the vehicle has to study the nature and extent of
impact step by step to form an opinion as to probable cause and nature
of accident. This is cross checked with the statement given in claim
form and any radical difference need be investigated. If investigation
is required the surveyor may carry out certain tests to determine
whether parts have sustained accidental damage. The extents of damage,
bent distortion sustained have to be verified. Serial numbers of
assemblies have to be physically checked. In case surveyor feels that
the claims may have to be treated on salvage loss / cash loss. Total
loss basis, the serial number of tyres should also be noted during the
first inspection. The final surveyor should make him comfortable in
using all common workshop equipment and machinery e.g. checking chassis
frame alignment commonly claims to save tyre wear out.</p>
<h2 id="h-re-inspection">h) Re-Inspection</h2>
<p>Re-inspection is a loss control measure carried out on
receipt of Final Survey report as well as photographs. It is resorted to
verify whether the insured has repaired the vehicle as assessed and
whether all replacements allowed have been actually replaced and the
salvage of parts is also inspected to determine appropriate economic
value. Further the re-inspection would require noting down serial number
of assemblies replaced / repaired. Re-inspection is neither resurvey nor
investigation. If any internal parts replacement is doubtful say for
want of salvage, re inspection surveyor is merely required to report to
insurer and should not go for dismantling of parts.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Role of Motor Surveyor in Loss Minimisation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Surveyors are expected to play a crucial
role in loss minimisation as far as motor claims are concerned. Besides
inspection of the vehicle for valuation, spot survey, final survey and
re-inspection; loss minimisation is achieved in following manner: i.
Ascertaining actual cause of accident and establishing a relation
between ―cause of accident‖ and damages caused there from. Studying the
damages to the vehicle and scrutinising estimates keeping in view the
cause of accident and probable damages i.</p>
<p>. By preparing an outer periphery of the damages at and furnishing

<p>. Assessment of genuine losses by segregating wear and tear and losses
caused due to poor upkeep.</p>
<p>iv. By ascertaining intrinsic value of salvage and some time helping in
disposal of salvage to contribute to reduction of losses. v. Apprising
insurers about the impact of new technology used in cars and its
implications on claims out go to help rate the risk adequately.</p>

<p>The above data clearly establishes that there is ample need to be
alarmed with rate of death being 31.6 per 100 accident cases at the
National level. Road safety has become one of the greatest social
problems of our time. On an average each year there are over 1,20,000
road accidents with number of persons killed and injured exceeding
21,000 and 1,10,000, respectively. The technical requirements applicable
to systems, components, separate technical units and vehicles should be
harmonised and specified in regulatory acts. Those regulatory acts
should primarily seek to ensure a high level of road safety, health
protection, environmental protection, energy efficiency and protection
against unauthorised use. This is a problem which concerns the entire
community and can be dealt with only by a multi-pronged action in which
multiple government departments such as Police, Public Works Department.
Transport Registration Authorities, Road Research Laboratories,
Organisations such as All India Motor Congress, Road Transport
Operators' Associations, Automobile Manufacturers etc., Vehicle Owners,
Users and pedestrians have to participate. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<h2 id="2-road-safety-promotion-by-insurance">2. Road Safety Promotion by Insurance</h2>
<p>The General Insurance Industry
plays a fairly significant role in promoting road safety and preventing
road accidents, although its contribution can, at best, be of an
indirect nature. The premium rating is so structured as to encourage
loss prevention on the part of the motoring public. Substantial
incentives in the premium are offered if the insured establishes an
accident free record. Again, premium discounts are offered if the
insured is willing to bear a portion of the loss himself. These
incentives not only result in reduced cost of insurance but also
encourage careful driving. Insurer's indirect contribution to road
accidents prevention is also exemplified in their system of the
underwriting which involves careful 'risks selection' and 'risk
improvement'. The bad driver or the accident prone driver is penalised
by compulsory excess; older vehicles are accepted only after
satisfactory inspection or subject to restricted coverage. These
measures have the effect of giving the insured a personal stake in
preventing accidents.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Causes of Accident</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The multiple losses which
occur in road transportation can be traced to three types of causes i.</p>
<p>'Human Cause' (e.g. drunken driving, over-speeding and other
violations of traffic law etc.),</p>
<p>ii. 'Physical Cause' (e.g. poor maintenance, overloading, untrained
drivers etc.) and iii. 'Environmental Cause' (e.g. bad road
conditions, inadequate lighting, insufficient traffic signs and signals,
loitering animals, multiple type of transport on roads, poor traffic
sense etc.). In other words, there are four primary factors responsible
for road accidents: i. The driver i . The vehicle ii. . The road users
iv. The road</p>
<p>The largest numbers of accidents are attributable to driver's fault. i.</p>
<h2 id="driver-education">Driver education</h2>
<p>The critical area of remedial action for the reduction of road accidents
would be the elimination or at least minimisation of driver error. Thus
driver education and training assumes crucial importance. The training
imparted by the motor training schools must be intensive and adequate to
provide the skills needed in complex and varied traffic situations.
Driver training ought to be designed not only to provide the necessary
driving skills but also to develop in the driver a strong sense of
„personal and social responsibility‟ for safe operation of motor
vehicle. It is also essential that testing standards of Road Transport
Authorities must be stringent and not available for a dime. In advanced
countries, numerous analysis pertaining to traffic accidents indicate
that ‗human factors&rsquo; such as bad habits, ignorance, lack of skill,
psychophysical disabilities, wrong driving attitudes and other personal
limitations account for the majority of accidents.</p>
<h2 id="ii-pedestrian-behaviour">ii. Pedestrian behaviour</h2>
<p>These negative factors also influence pedestrian behaviour,
especially in the major cities and towns, where there is heavy
concentration of population. Improving pedestrian behaviour is a long
term process. It is essentially a matter of self-discipline. Safety
consciousness and civic sense will have to be fostered right from the
elementary school level. Secondly, enforcement of traffic laws by the
police and the law courts will bring about more responsible pedestrian
behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="iii-compulsory-vehicle-maintenance">iii. Compulsory vehicle Maintenance</h2>
<p>Defective vehicle ranks
second among the causes contributing to road accidents. The issue has
three dimensions: (a) Regular maintenance of the vehicle on a voluntary
basis, (b) Compulsory maintenance through periodical inspection of
vehicles by Road Transport Authorities and (c) Post-accident repair
inspection by both the Insurance Surveyors and the Road Transport
Authorities in case of major damage.</p>
<h2 id="4-role-of-fleet-operators">4. Role of Fleet Operators</h2>
<p>Stick to high standards of maintenance, but
the majority of truck operators in the country are single operators who
neither have money nor the capacity to manage regular upkeep and
maintenance of their vehicle. Therefore, the role of the inspection wing
of the Road Transport Authority becomes all the more significant. Large
fleet operators (both in the private and public sectors) have shown
concern for fuel conservation and accident prevention.</p>
<h2 id="example-4">Example</h2>
<p>Several private operators, State Road Transport Corporations and
public owned corporations have installed tachographs in their vehicles
which is a precision instrument which records a vehicle's driving
pattern along the route for a period of 24 hours. It gives an accurate
record of the distance travelled, stoppages enroute (authorised or
unauthorised), braking pattern, various speed levels etc. The Tachograph
provides irrefutable evidence in case of accidents by giving relevant
information about the speed, time and place of accident. For the driver,
it is also an assurance of safety as he will be warned when he is
overspeeding. The Tachograph promotes good driving habits and these
results in saving of fuel and maintenance costs and reduction of road
accidents. A number of countries in the world notably, Japan, Germany,
France, Switzerland, Sweden, Brazil and Australia have made it mandatory
equipment in public transport vehicles.</p>

been recognised and the Transport Development Council of the Ministry of
Shipping and Transport is actively engaged, inter alia, in suggesting to
the State Governments various measures for expansion and modernisation
of road transport. Some of the recommendations of this Council, having a
bearing on road safety, relate to:</p>
<p>i.Strengthening or creating facilities for highway testing, control and
research for consideration of State Governments who is vested the bulk
of road construction. For example, a model scheme for organising State
Testing and Control Laboratories prepared by the Central Road Research
Institute has been circulated to the States for their implementation.</p>
<p>i. Planning, design and construction of road facilities.</p>
<p>i. Adequate, proper and systematic maintenance of the National Highways
and other roads in the country, through regular resurfacing, routine
maintenance operations and &quot;Special Repairs&quot; and &quot;Flood Damage&quot;
repairs.</p>
<p>iv. Creation of separate Traffic Engineering cells in the Public Works
Department to serve as a focal agency to analyse all the traffic and
accident data on a continuing basis, enabling identification of the
vulnerable accident-prone spots and the remedial measures to be adopted.
Studies by various agencies show that quite a number of road accidents
occurred at junctions and at check-barriers. The Transport Development
Council has made recommendations for improving barrier design and
construction of lay-byes. It is also found that a large number of side
road intersections are poorly designed which contribute to high rate of
accidents at these locations. The Transport Development Council&rsquo;s
recommendations relate to installation of road sign markings,
channelisation, etc. The Transport Development Council is regularly
monitoring the progress made by the State Governments in all these
areas. The other agencies engaged in Road Research are: i. The Central
Road Research Institute, New Delhi, set up in 1952, conducts research on
road engineering under the administrative control of the Ministry of
Shipping and Transport.</p>
<p>i. Highway Research Board set up in 1973, under the auspices of the
Indian Roads Congress for the promotion and coordination of road
research at the national level.</p>
<p>i.. The Road Wing of the Union Ministry of Shipping and Transport is also
engaged in road research and promotion of application of new techniques
in the safe construction of roads and bridges.</p>

<p>'Violations of traffic laws' leading to accidents on
the road will be classified under which of the below causes of
accidents? I. Human Cause II. Physical Cause III. Environmental Cause
IV. None of the above</p>
<h2 id="e-frauds-in-motor-od-claims">E. Frauds in Motor OD Claims</h2>
<ol>
<li>Seamless Claims Management There is a
saying &ldquo;Insurance fraud is a bigger industry than insurance business&rdquo;. A
major problem in the non-life insurance space is the endemic nature of
fraud, waste and revenue leakage. Internationally motor fraud range is
in between 10% to 15% of the insurance claim payout.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example In the United Kingdom, for instance, undetected general
insurance claims total £2.1 billion a year, adding an average £50 to the
annual costs individual policyholders face each year. It is therefore
likely that in India too this may be substantial. Motor insurance is the
largest single portfolio that impacts the lives of all sectors of
society in India. A study carried out by India forensic stated that
insurance companies have collectively lost a whopping Rs. 304.01
billion, or about 9 percent of the total estimated size of the industry
into Motor Claims, due to various frauds in 2011.</p>
<h2 id="2-frauds-in-motor-insurance">2. Frauds in motor insurance</h2>
<h2 id="a-frauds-from-external-and-internal-sources">a) Frauds from external and internal sources</h2>
<p>Fraud can be from: i. External sources i.e. the insuring public
or ii. Internal i.e. insurers, agents and intermediaries More often it
is a nexus between both groups that perpetrate fraud. The fraud can
range from misrepresentation at the time of taking insurance, e.g.,
renewal of a policy much after its expiry date. It has often been
observed that the vehicle is already damaged or stolen when the proposer
seeks insurance. Insurers have tried to counteract such cases treating
‗break&ndash;in&ndash;insurance&rsquo; as a rigorous methodology insisting on physical
inspection of the vehicle, tracing its chassis number, before acceptance
for insurance.</p>
<h2 id="b-multiple-insurance-cover-on-same-vehicle">b) Multiple insurance cover on same Vehicle</h2>
<p>Another type of fraud results after the insurance has been taken. The same vehicle
may be insured with two or more insurers and claims are reported with
all. This is due to a nexus between repairers and claimants. This type
of fraud is much more difficult to detect, in the absence of a Central
Repository for reporting all accidents. The recent trend to earmark
authorised repairers by insurers has helped in some small way. However,
the commercial vehicle field is still open to such frauds. The
black-listing of such repairers is one of the ways of reducing such
attempts. Regular visit and appraisal of such shoddy repairers and
disseminating such information to other insurers, may help in preventing
such frauds.</p>
<h2 id="c-inflated-bills-of-repairs">c) Inflated Bills of Repairs</h2>
<p>Frauds may also occur when inflated bills of repairs are produced. The insured takes recourse to
claiming in excess of the damages sustained or including earlier minor
damage repairs in the claimed amount. There may also be forged bills to
explain some major damage cost.</p>
<h2 id="d-faked-accidents-or-burglaries">d) Faked Accidents or Burglaries</h2>
<p>These are other types of fraud that can occur. Rotation of insurance personnel
and intermediaries, regular visits to repairers and if necessary
investigations of frequent claims or from specific regions or
intermediaries could be followed to keep a check on such frauds.</p>
<p>In accident-related claims, frauds are difficult to identify and / or
locate because the validation mechanism to detect fraudulent claims
depends on verification by a Surveyor. Insurers have limited ability to
detect if the Surveyor is complicit in making a fraudulent claim or has
been duped by the claimant.</p>
<h2 id="e-staged-collisions">e) Staged Collisions</h2>
<p>A new phenomenon is emerging in stage collisions which are mainly managed in the manner of a
scripted film where vehicles, drivers are rented and asked to drive on a
specific road at specific time in the garb of making a film and later
the claims are put in.</p>
<p>Example An actual film maker first arranged a collision and later
preferred a claim. However, forensic help and telecommunication
satellite came to rescue of insurer in bursting the fraud. 3. Way to
Mitigate Frauds a) Context-Specific Data A way to mitigate fraud risk is
to ensure that the insurer gets highly contextspecific data regarding
the claim. This can include having the claimant or the agent identify
the exact location immediately after the accident and capturing images
related to damages to property or injuries to people. Having this
context-rich data availablity enables insurers to process the claim
rapidly while also building an evidence repository, should the claim
need to be investigated later. A mobile-based digital assessor that
guides an agent or a customer through the process of gathering claims
related data can speed up the claims process and insurer&rsquo;s response time
to customers, which are the primary complaints by Indian customers
regarding customer service from insurers. b) Digital Claims Assessor
Digital Claims Assessor enables Surveyors and customers to gather all
pertinent data relevant to filing a claim after an accident and also
provides additional information such as location of nearby hospitals and
repair centers for their make of the vehicle. The data collected is
customised based on the make and model of the vehicle, the location of
the damaged and the geo-location information of the accident.</p>
<p>c) Leverage Technology Solutions The insurance industry in India is
unable to fully exploit newer technologies to lower costs and reach out
to more technology-friendly and connected customers. Agents and
intermediaries still remain key to the sales and education process, but
are becoming less effective. The discontent with intermediaries and
insurers, being very high among customers, insurers need to leverage
technology solutions such as ‗mobile business intelligence&rsquo; to make
agents more effective by adopting a more personalised approach to
customers. At the same time, channels such as social media and the Web
need to be exploited as much as possible to engage customers. The
contacts initiated through these channels can be further exploited
effectively by a customer support desk, which uses „business
intelligence solutions‟, to personalise interactions with customers.
This multi-channel approach that leverages business intelligence and
mobile technology offers insurers an effective way to succeed in a
highly competitive and fast-changing Indian insurance market.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>a) Doctrine of cause of accident: The cause of accident and
probable damage caused due to a particular reason is the most important
aspect to be taken into consideration in all motor claims. b) Own damage
claims: From the procedural viewpoint, claims settlement involves three
phases: preliminary scrutiny, assessment of the loss and settlement. c)
Claim Form: The format and the contents of the claim form differ from
Company to Company but the Claim form contains questions relating to the
following particulars: i. Insured i . Vehicle ii. . Use of the vehicle
iv. Driver v. Witnesses vi. Injury to driver / occupant vi . Damage to
the vehicle vii. . Sketch d) The survey report would amplify the
information obtained in the claim form and also incorporate additional
information. There is no standardised form for survey report, but the
following information is expected in a survey report i. Accident i. .
Assessment of loss i. . Net liability of insurer iv. General
observations e) Whenever a surveyor finds that a vehicle is either
beyond repairs or the cost of loss repair exceeds 75% of the IDV; he
assesses the claim on a Constructive Total Loss basis (CTL). f) Total
loss can also arise due to the theft of the vehicle remaining untraced
by the police authorities. g) Claims on repair basis also arise when the
stolen vehicles are recovered in damaged condition and / or stripped of
some parts.</p>
<p>h) Under certain circumstances, insurers settle Total Loss claims
without claiming the salvage (Net of salvage basis) or reimburse the
insured with his repairs bills without submission of repairs bill or
without even verifying whether the vehicle is or will be repaired or not
(cash Loss basis). These types of settlements are in the nature of
compromise mode of settlements and are known as &quot;Cash Loss&quot;
settlements. i) Fire Damage to Vehicle: The most usual cause of motor
vehicle fires is the failure of electrical system and this most
frequently follows repairs which have involved removal of the engine.
This usually causes the wiring to be disturbed which breaks down the
insulation and results in a fire perhaps months later. j) Loss caused by
Mechanical / Electrical Break Down are excluded from the policy cover
but any damage consequent thereon would normally be the subject of
indemnity. k) The following factors are assessed for Post Automotive
Repair: i. Labour charges /Time schedule &amp; Rate i . Painting component /
technology ii. . Spare parts pricing l) Compensation for third party
injury or property damage is decided by Compromise through Mediation,
Conciliation through Lok-adalats and MACT Awards. m) Insurance Surveyors
and Loss assessors (Licencing, Professional Requirements and Code of
Conduct Regulations) 2000 Chapter VI gives code of conduct viz. i. To
behave ethically and with integrity implying fairness and truthfulness,
i . Strive for objectivity, ii. . Carry out his work with due diligence,
care and skill, iv. Keep him up dated, and v. Provide free professional
training n) Two important steps in motor survey are human relationship
and surveying ability. o) Motor survey requires good technical knowledge
about repairability, prevailing market conditions, availability of
spares, cost of repairs, and an ability to convince repairer and insured
and take on the spot decisions. p) Insurer's indirect contribution to
road accidents prevention is also exemplified in their system of the
underwriting which involves careful 'risks selection' and 'risk
improvement'.</p>
<p>q) The multiple losses which occur in road transportation can be traced
to three types of causes: i. Human cause i . Physical cause ii. .
Environmental cause r) Fraud can be from: i. External sources i.e. the
insuring public or i . Internal i.e. insurers, agents and intermediaries
s) Frauds in motor insurance include: i. Frauds from external and
internal sources i . Multiple insurance cover on same Vehicle i i.
Inflated Bills of Repairs iv. Faked Accidents or Burglaries v. Staged
