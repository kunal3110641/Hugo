(AIR 1977). Section 169 (3) Minor claimant: When any compromise is made
on behalf of the minor in a claim, the safe guard provided in Or 323,

1988, MACT shall have all the powers of a Civil Court for the purpose of
taking evidence, enforcing attendance of witness, and compelling the
discovery and production of documents etc. The Claims Tribunal is deemed
to be a Civil Court for all the purposes of Section 195 and Chapter XXVI
of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. Therefore, one should be
familiar with some of the important Sections of Code of Civil Procedure
1908, which governs the powers of the Civil Courts.</p>

<p>The proceedings in the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal are summary in
nature, without following technicalities of Code of Civil Procedure or
strict compliance of Evidence Act. Therefore it is necessary to know the
stages in MACT claims proceedings.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Procedure for Filing of Claim</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>First the applicant inwards the claim application in Registry for
availing compensation as envisaged under Motor Vehicle Act 1988. The
registrar of Claims Tribunal after making initial scrutiny allots the
Court for admission hearing. The date of in-warding the application
determines when the application was filed.</p>
<h2 id="a-notice--summons">a) Notice / Summons</h2>
<p>The Claims Tribunal to whom the claim is allotted, passes the order of issue
notice i.e., issues summons to the opponent. All supporting documents
produced by the applicant are required to be accompanied with the
summons. If the requirement as per rule 254 is not received, a letter
should be written to MACT Judge. Therefore, before the matter is listed
for hearing, the petitioners advocate should prepare his own short
notes, which would be helpful to him in narrating the facts. IC-72 MOTOR
INSURANCE</p>
<p>The points, which are to be urged at the Bar should be jotted down
precisely and the strongest point should be argued first.</p>
<h2 id="b-appearance-of-defendant">b) Appearance of defendant</h2>
<p>The opponent has to appear on the schedule date personally
or through his advocate. The panel advocate&rsquo;s primary role is to use his
professional skills to protect the interest of insurance company,
besides protecting insurance company from the apathy of insured owner /
driver and at times collusion by insured owner / driver with the Third
Party claimants. The advocate is required to initially move an
application to obtain comprehensive ‗search report&rsquo; after having details
of documents filed by petitioner. The copies of such documents are given
to the insurer to trace insurance particulars and expedite the process
of satisfying the liability of the insured as envisaged in Motor Vehicle
Act, 1988. On submission of search report by the Advocate and on the
basis of confirmation of the insurance and coverage for insured vehicle
in the said accident, the panel advocate submits a „Say Report‟ to
registrar. In case insurance is not accepted or not confirmed „No Say
Report‟ is submitted.</p>
<h2 id="c-regarding-negligence">c) Regarding Negligence</h2>
<p>The defence of contributory negligence and composite negligence also needs to be
verified before finalising written statement. If there is no statutory
defence available, the defence of negligence is helpful in reducing
quantum. The contributory negligence is the negligence wherein victim is
also contributing to the occurrence of the accident, and this fact can
be adjudged by spot, panchnama and statement of witnesses. The
investigator has to forward the statement of the driver, if recorded, to
help in defending the case. The composite negligence is negligence where
the victim is not directly contributing to the accident i.e., death or
injury is caused due to no fault of the victim e.g., if there is a
collision of two vehicles, an occupant in a car or pillion rider of a
two wheeler is not contributing to the accident, but is a victim in that
accident. Hence, before finalizing written statement one has to verify
under which category of negligence the case is to be pleaded.</p>
<h2 id="d-regarding-quantum">d) Regarding quantum</h2>
<p>The information regarding quantum is also to be
obtained through the investigator. The Income tax return, salary slip
etc. are helpful in reducing the quantum or at least conclusion can be
drawn regarding genuineness of the claim. Therefore, written statement
is the only document where in all the defences are to be pleaded without
fail.</p>
<p>Necessary care should be taken that pleading in written statement
without proving and establishing defence is of no use.</p>
<h2 id="e-claims-under-structured-formula">e) Claims under structured formula</h2>
<p>Section 163 A is based on statutory structured
formula, wherein negligence is not to be pleaded i.e., the claim is to
be contested on, income and age of the deceased. Thus when u/s 163 a
claim is awarded one has to take care about the income of deceased and
his age, without pleading negligence. f) Filing of Written Statement by
Insurer There are normally two types of defenses: i. One is statutory
defence provided in the statute itself whereas i . Other is factual
defence which is made out in a written statement If a case is fit to
contest, the written statement is a crucial document for pleading in
court by the opponent. The purpose of written statement is to let
petitioner know the defenses pleaded by the contesting defendant
insurer. Pleadings taken by panel advocate in written statement should
be precise and adequate. Written Statement (Order 8 Rule 1 CPC) The
Order 8 of CPC defines written statement. The written statement is
required to be filed either by admitting or denying liability within 90
days from the date of service of summons. However, considering the
procedure before Claims Tribunal, the aforesaid rule is not meticulously
followed. The written Statement should not be filed on general denial
basis. The denial should be specific and not evasive. The following
measures are to be taken while scrutinising the written statement: i.</p>
<p>There must be specific pleading in the written statement, either denying
or accepting liability.</p>
<p>i.. Defence points and new facts must be pleaded specifically.</p>
<p>i.. Insurance Company must deal specifically with each allegation of fact
which it does not admit.</p>
<p>iv. Not admitted is no denial and no knowledge is worse than not
admitted and these words should be avoided in the Written Statement. v.
It is legally necessary to file the documents along with written
statement on which the defence relies, before the Tribunal Court.</p>
<p>vi. Written Statement is to be filed before the first hearing, and the
insurance company should cause no undue delay in filing the written
statement.</p>
<p>i.Non-joinder of necessary party (Order 1 Rule 9 and 10 of CPC)</p>
<p>In the Third Party liability cases the insured owner, driver of the
insured vehicle, as well as owner, driver and the insurer of the other
vehicle; in case of collision are generally necessary parties to the
proceedings. Further, all legal heirs of the victim are also necessary
parties. Wherever, such necessary parties are not impleaded in the
proceedings, a contention can be made in the written statement that the
suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties.</p>
<h2 id="ii-owner-is-not-a-third-party">ii. Owner is not a Third Party</h2>
<p>Where an applicant himself was driving the vehicle, and was
hurt in the accident, he cannot be accepted as a third party as he is a
joint tortfeasor. See [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Hansraj Kodala
&amp; others) 2001 (5) ACJ 827 (SC)]. The Gujarat High Court has laid down
a principle that application under Section 140 of MV Act 1988 alone is
not maintainable. The applicant must file an application under Section
166 also. As the application for no fault liability under Section 140 is
a part of application u/s 166, for fault liability. The Section 166
requires the person at fault to pay compensation. How one can claim
compensation for his own fault? The driver is not entitled to get relief
under Section 140 for his own negligence. The definition of liability
under Section 146 includes Section 140 also. When the insurer is not
liable to pay compensation under Section 166 how can liability under
Section 140 be passed on to insurance company?</p>
<h2 id="iii-driver-is-not-a-third-party">iii. Driver is not a Third Party</h2>
<p>A driver cannot claim compensation in MACT for his own
negligence because he is liable to pay compensation. [2001 (7) ACJ 1329
(MP)] In TNSRTC vs. Natrajan &amp; others, [II (2003) ACC 1 (SC)] the
claimant himself was driver of TNSRTC Bus and he was found negligent to
the extent of 50%. The Corporation was held vicariously liable for
negligence of claimant himself. In [2001 (5) ACJ 998] it was held that
owner is liable to pay compensation to the third party and the driver is
not a third party.</p>
<h2 id="iv-mis-joinder-of-necessary-party">iv. Mis-joinder of necessary party</h2>
<p>In other situation, wherever a
person who is not a necessary party but has been made as a party,
contention can be made in the written statement to the effect that the
suit is bad for mis-joinder of necessary parties viz. GIC does not issue
Motor Policy, GIC has been made a party hence there is misjoinder of
necessary party. In a case where the widow filed a claim application,
though the deceased left behind six children, it was non-joinder of
necessary parties.</p>
<h2 id="v-right-to-file-additional-written-statement-before-hearing">v. Right to file Additional Written Statement before hearing</h2>
<p>It is necessary to reserve the right for filing additional
written statement as and when fresh facts come to our notice at a
subsequent stage. Additional written statement can be filed before
commencement of the hearing. Our written statement should incorporate
one paragraph reserving our right to file additional written statement.
The Tribunal has inherent power to permit the procedure for putting
forward ground of law in defence by way of an additional written
statement (1967 ACJ 153).</p>
<h2 id="vi-amendment-to-written-statement-order-6-rule-17">vi. Amendment to Written Statement (Order 6 Rule 17)</h2>
<p>It is essential that on receipt of the written statement
concerned insurance company&rsquo;s officer should scrutinise it properly
before signing the same. At the time of scrutiny it is necessary to
ensure that frivolous pleas and pleas of general nature are avoided. The
Written Statement can be amended as per the above provision of the CPC
at any stage before completion of evidence. If it is necessary to amend
a particular contention in the written statement, an amendment petition
can be filed under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC seeking amendment. This
provision can be invoked to amend particular contentions on receipt of
fresh facts or contrary facts based on documentary evidence.</p>
<h2 id="vii-leading-defence-by-insurers">vii. Leading Defence by Insurers</h2>
<p>Section 147 of 1988 Act provides for the
mandatory Motor Policy. The Policy is a basic document; hence the
defences available on Motor Policy are especially on the issue of third
party liability, and limit of liability for third party property damage.
When these types of defence pleas are used in a case, the respondent
must submit Policy terms and conditions, other details regarding time of
Policy, period of policy, registration number of vehicle etc. If the
defence of Policy is pleaded, then the dealing advocate should be
instructed specifically regarding limits of liability in the Policy,
premium cheque dishonour if any, and additional premium, if paid.</p>
<p>Section 149(2) of 1988 Act provides defence which statute has provided.
Therefore, these two sections are crucial while finalising the written
statement; pleading, proving and establishment. There is ample
difference in the three concepts of pleading, proving and establishing
i.e. (a) Before proving defence one has to plead the defence, (b) After
pleading defense, efforts should be made to explore how it can be proved
by way of documents. (c) After providing proof of the document, one has
to satisfy the court that defence is established.</p>
<p>Example If defence for non-holding of licence by the driver is pleaded,
we have to: i.First plead about the non-holding of licence,</p>
<p>i.. As a next step, parties to prove in charge sheet Section 3(18) of MV
Act 1988 whether it is leveled or not. To prove said fact, the Insurer
has to submit copy of notice issued through insurance company to produce
driving license, certified copy of charge sheet to get driving licence
exhibited, arrange summons against driver at the time of leading
evidence on behalf of Insurance company, exanimation of investigator and
finally to submit and get exhibited Policy terms and conditions.</p>
<p>i.. When all these documents have been proved by way of evidence, then
only we can say that the defence is established and proved.</p>
<h2 id="viii-filing-of-no-fault-liability-application">viii. Filing of No-Fault Liability application</h2>
<p>For filing no-fault liability
application, the applicant has to undertake compliance of Rule 255 of
Motor Vehicle Rules. If the insurance company admits insurance, No-Fault
Liability order is passed and, thereafter, matter is posted for framing
issues. Section 140 is retrospectively applicable to pending claim
[1992 ACJ 977].</p>
<h2 id="g-out-of-court-or-compromise-settlement">g) Out of Court or Compromise Settlement</h2>
<p>The investigation report helps in determining merits of the claim for
compromise settlement or to take a decision to contest the case. When
the claim is admitted based on documentary evidences and no statutory
defenses are available to the company to contest, adequate efforts
should be made to reach a compromise on the claims through alternative
forum like DICC/RICC/Conciliatory panels or as per individual Financial
Authority according to the merit of each case.</p>
<h2 id="framing-of-issues">Framing of Issues</h2>
<p>Basically, issues are the points on which Court decides the case and
arrive at the conclusion. Issues are of two types, i.e., issues on: 
facts, and  law Generally, issues are framed on material proposition of
fact or law averred by one party and denied by the other party. The
issue means the points to be proved by the opponents who are contesting.
When there are rival contentions, the issues are framed to facilitate
adjudication. The contesting parties accordingly have to lead and prove
said facts. Need to frame Issues (Order 14 Rule 16 CPC): After the
filing of written statement, Claims Tribunal proceeds for trial on
deciding the points involved. Accordingly issues are framed on the vital
disputed points requiring decision. From the insurers point of view it
is important to ensure that the issues on the vital defence points are
framed, so that the existing Court / Appellate court would become bound
to decide on those points on analysis of evidence. If issues on vital
defence points are framed and decided in respect of production and
proving of evidence, then the Insurance Company will be in a better
position to file appeal challenging that point. The panel advocates are
required to be briefed about framing of issues and in this regard
necessary instructions are issued. The date fixed for framing of issues
should be intimated to the dealing Office, so that officer /
representative can attend the Court, if necessary. The issues framed in
a particular case should be intimated to the office concerned by the
advocate.</p>
<h2 id="ii-leading-evidence-in-claims-tribunal">ii. Leading Evidence in Claims Tribunal</h2>
<p>The defenses available
to insurers are limited as per Section 149(2) of the 1988 Act (as
amended). Therefore, the insurance company contests the claim on very
limited grounds as envisaged under the statutory provision. Wherever,
the insured and / or driver remain ex-parte or do not contest or do not
appear even after filing of written statement or there is collusion
between the claimants and the insured, the provision u/s 170 of 1988 Act
can be invoked and an application can be filed before the Tribunal,
seeking to take over all the defenses available to the insured / driver
so that insurance company may contest the claim on merits beyond the
statutory provision. In these circumstances insurance company can even
challenge the quantum of compensation all alone.</p>
<p>The applicant has to produce evidence in order to prove his case and now
a day&rsquo;s examination in chief is filed by way of affidavit, after which
the opponents advocate has to cross examine the applicant. The said
cross examination has to be conducted on the basis of pleadings made in
the written statement. Thus the cross-examination has to be conducted as
per defence raised in written statement.</p>
<h2 id="iii-evidence-by-opponent-insurers">iii. Evidence by Opponent Insurers</h2>
<p>Production and proving of documentary evidence: Pleas taken in
the written statement, issues framed on defence points of documents,
require each and every document to be filed in support of defence, to be
proved by production and proving of documents. Each and every document
filed in support of defence plea has to be proved; otherwise plea taken
but not proved will not have any evidential value in the eyes of law as
per the provision of the Evidence Act. It is a settled position of law
that pleas taken, but not proved have no evidential value as per the
provisions of the Indian Evidence Act. Therefore, it is of utmost
importance to prove the documents on which our defence relies, by
summoning the concerned persons, who have issued the documents; e.g.,
when we take the plea regarding fake driving licence and also breach of
specified policy conditions, it is required that concerned RTO should
appear before the Claims Tribunal to prove the validity of driving
licence while policy conditions should be proved through insurance
company&rsquo;s representatives.</p>
<h2 id="iv-compelling-discovery--production-of-documents">iv. Compelling Discovery &amp; Production of Documents</h2>
<p>Wherever certain documents are in possession of the other
party and in spite of our best efforts the same could not be procured,
Section 169(2) of the M.V. Act 1988 may be invoked compelling discovery
and production of documents; e.g., for production of driving licence
particulars this provision will be of help. The opponent has to lead
evidence as per stand / defence pleaded in written statement and
thereafter, defence of opponent if any has to be adduced and evidence
gets proved.</p>
<h2 id="v-appointment-of-local-commission-for-obtaining-evidence">v. Appointment of Local Commission for Obtaining Evidence</h2>
<p>Wherever the concerned Road Transport Authority (RTA) is situated far
away or in other States or beyond 300 KM from the place of trial, and
inspite of the repeated attempts the attendance of RTA is difficult for
adducing evidence, application may be filed for examination of RTA
through Local Commission. Accordingly the courts appoint commission who
visits the RTA and records his statement, and such reports of the
commission are admissible as evidence.</p>
<h2 id="vi-evidential-value-of-investigation-report">vi. Evidential value of Investigation Report</h2>
<p>Generally much credence is
not given by the Claims Tribunals to the investigation report obtained
through Insurance Company&rsquo;s investigator. It is, therefore, necessary
that the investigation report should corroborate facts along with other
evidences to make it acceptable in the Court. The investigators should
be specifically advised to submit the investigation report along with
supporting documents / evidences. Mere detailing of facts and
circumstance in the investigation is not enough for being admitted as
evidence. Revision Petition for interim orders (Section 115 CPC): Claims
Tribunal is a court subordinate to High Court and a revision under
Section 115 CPC is maintainable [1991 ACJ 150(SC)]. The provision is
for filing revision petition challenging interim or introductory order
if any.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>In case of rejection of any amendment petition, or petition for
additional evidence or of suggestive issues by the Tribunal, revision
can be filed challenging that particular rejection order before the High
Court.</p>
<h2 id="h-arguments-during-proceedings">h) Arguments during Proceedings</h2>
<p>The arguments are advanced on the
basis of pleadings, exhibited / proved documents, and on the basis of
admissions in cross-examination. Where the case requires that an
Advocate must present his point, he should not give up merely because of
an unfavorable expression of opinion by the Judges. The business of an
advocate is to convince or persuade the Judge to his point of view.
Therefore, unless the advocate combines tact with knowledge of law and
facts, he cannot succeed in the case.</p>
<h2 id="i-citation-of-case-laws">i. Citation of Case Laws:</h2>
<p>During arguments, case laws are to be referred to and then comes the last
stage, the pronouncement of judgment. Selected citation of the cases,
which lay down the law in support of the contentions of an advocate, is
more effective.</p>

<h2 id="a-award-by-the-claims-tribunal">a) Award by the Claims Tribunal</h2>
<p>After the evidence is completed, the court passes an award deciding on each
issue involved on the basis of issues so framed. As per Section 168 (2)
a copy of the award can be delivered to the parties concerned within a
period of 15 days from the date of award and as per Section 168(3) the
award should be satisfied within 30 days from the date of award unless
it merits appeal.</p>
<h2 id="i-intimation-of-judgement-and-deposit-of-award">i. Intimation of Judgement and deposit of award</h2>
<p>The Honourable court delivers judgement on the basis of available
evidence and documents. The Supreme Court in [ (Rajasthan State Road
Transport Corporation. vs. Poonam Pahwa &amp; others) CA no. 435/97] held
that mere deposit of the amount is not enough. It has to be intimated to
the decree holder by the judgement debtor so as not to attract further
interest liability. Therefore, it is necessary to intimate to the
claimants regarding satisfaction of awards in compliance of the Apex
Court decision.</p>
<h2 id="ii-review-of-order">ii. Review of Order</h2>
<p>The claims tribunal was held to have
all the trappings of a Civil Court by virtue of Sec.169 (2) also and in
order to do justice it could invoke such powers. While following the
decision in [(1997 ACJ 778 (Ker)] the decision in [2005 ACJ 1563
(Ker)] was overturned in [(Asmath Khan vs. Chadrahasa Bangara) 2007
ACJ 1071 (Ker)]: [(Parashram Mahadev Divate vs. United India Insurance
Co. Ltd) 2007 ACJ 1438 (Kant)]. (a) In the context of IT Act, 1961 in
[2008 (6) Supreme 653], it has been held that passing an order in
ignorance of a High Court judgment would be apparent error on the face
of record. (b) The Tribunal cannot stretch its inherent power so as to
include the power of reviewing its own order [1967 ACJ192] except when
fraud is detected later.</p>
<h2 id="iii-appeal-against-award">iii. Appeal against award</h2>
<p>If the aggrieved party desires, it can file an appeal. The petitioner has to take due
care in awarding the application for obtaining a certified copy of the
award, so as to avoid delay and other complications at the time of
preferring appeal.</p>
<p>An appeal can be filed within 90 days from the date of award, if the
awarded amount is excessive, inappropriate to age, income status of the
victims and any other point of law is involved. At the time of filing of
appeal, 50% of the awarded amount or Rs.2, 500/- whichever is less has
to be deposited in the manner directed by the High Court.</p>
<h2 id="iv-additional-evidence-in-appeal-order-41-rule---27-cpc">iv. Additional evidence in appeal (Order 41 Rule - 27 CPC)</h2>
<p>In case, certain important /
vital evidence in support of our defence plea could not be produced
before the Trial Court in spite of reasonable efforts, additional
evidence can be produced at the appellate stage under ORDER 41 Rule 27
of CPC. Here the burden lies on the insurance company to explain
non-production of the evidence at the Tribunal / Trial stage. In the
case of National Insurance Company Ltd vs. Jugal Kishore, Policy copy in
support of limited liability contention was admitted at the Supreme
Court stage.</p>
<h2 id="v-revision-petition-at-high-court">v. Revision Petition at High Court</h2>
<p>In a case, where the
insurer had satisfied the interim award under protest, and the claim
petition came to be withdrawn after compromise with the owner of the
vehicle. But the insurer subsequently challenged the same by a writ
petition, as there was collusion and fraud. The High Court allowed the
relief and remitted the matter for disposal on merits. [(National
Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Mohan) 2007 ACJ 1321 (Raj))]. In a case where a
claim was laid under Sec.166 and converted into a claim under Sec.163-A,
the challenge to this order was scotched in appeal, as not illegal.
[(Ravinder v Subash Chand) 2007 ACJ 1365 (P&amp;H)]. To compute the amount
in dispute for considering maintainability of the appeal, interest,
costs, compensatory costs etc. have to be included in arriving at the
sum. It was held in [1984 ACJ 408 (Ker)]. [(Ajesh Alex vs. John) 2007
ACJ 1481 (Ker)] that, the debtor having to pay the entire liability the
amount in dispute would include all the said sums. In [(National
Insurance Co Ltd vs. Duwas Ram Yadav) 2007 ACJ 763 (P&amp;H)] it was held
that when no appeal was provided for under Sec.173 as the amount in
dispute was less than Rs. 10,000/-, a revision cannot be introduced. A
revision under Article 227 were also held not maintainable in [(Jabir
vs. MACT) 2007 ACJ 885 (All)]. See [(New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Charubala Das) 2007 ACJ 1146 (Gau)] in which it was held that since the
Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error the insurer could seek
correction of the same in revision. In another case it was held that a
revision under Sec.115 CPC would not lie [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd.
vs. Manju) 2007 ACJ 1538 (All)].</p>
<p>The insurer had not availed permission under Sec.170 of MV Act, 1988. In
its absence, they sought to file a revision petition against the award.
It was held that such revision was not tenable, as it would enable them
to circumvent the statutory obligation and make the provisions thereto
nugatory. It was so decided in [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Liansangpuii) 2007 ACJ 801 (Gau)]: [(Calcutta State Transport
Corporation vs. Sudama Ghosh) 2007 (3) T A C 793 (Cal)] relying
primarily on [(Sadhana Lodh vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd.) 2003 ACJ
505 (SC)].</p>
<h2 id="b-first-appeal-single-judge">b) First Appeal (Single Judge)</h2>
<p>In the first place, an appeal
is generally heard by a Single Judge which is called the first appeal.
On disposal of the first appeal there is a provision for filing of
appeal before the Division Bench.</p>
<h2 id="c-letters-patent-appeal-lpa">c) Letters Patent Appeal (LPA)</h2>
<p>The appeal before the Division Bench challenging the order of the Single
Judge is called the Letters Patent Appeal (LPA). The Letters Patent
Appeal can be considered meticulously and very carefully at the RO
level. Letters Patent Appeal challenging an order passed by a single
judge of the High Court under Section 140 of the act is maintainable.
Refer Chandra Kant Sinha vs. Oriental Insurance company Ltd and others
[2002 ACJ 210 (SC)] Section 100 A of the Code of Civil Procedure
(inserted by Amendment Act 22 of 2002) The full bench of Andhra Pradesh
High Court held that the right of appeal available under Letters Patent
has been taken away by Section 100 A of the code of Civil Procedure

<h2 id="d-special-leave-petition-slp">d) Special Leave Petition (SLP)</h2>
<p>There is a provision to file Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court within
90 days from the date of Judgement challenging the order of the Division
Bench as and when necessary depending on the merit of the case. It may
be noted that all appeals have to be considered at the Regional Office
level and all SLPs have to be considered at Head Office level
irrespective of the amount involved. The insurance company nowadays
instructs the advocate to add the pleadings regarding Section 170 of
1988 Act. However, Sec. 170 is a matter of procedure wherein application
is made if insured fails to contest the claim, hence S. 170 can&rsquo;t be a
part of pleadings as such in anticipation. 446</p>
<h2 id="2-steps-to-be-taken-in-third-party-motor-accident-cases">2. Steps to be taken in Third Party Motor Accident Cases</h2>
<h2 id="a-third-party-claims-fatal-and-non-fatal">a) Third Party Claims (Fatal and Non-fatal)</h2>
<p>Intimation about an accident resulting into
third party claim is received through insured either directly or by
mentioning while lodging own damage claim or by Claimant directly or by
MACT / Courts by notice or through accident report from Police in
Form-54 prescribed under Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989.</p>
<h2 id="iappointment-of-investigator">i.Appointment of Investigator</h2>
<p>An investigation about the accident is carried out to collect the
relevant data to quantify reasonable and just compensation in respect of
all Third Party Claims. The companies should ensure that this
investigation helps them in finalising out of court settlement at the
earliest. If necessary, on receipt of notice from the MACT a competent
Advocate from the panel may be appointed. The relevant documents and
information should be given to him immediately to enable him to draft
written statement on behalf of the Company and ensure that proper
defence is taken where necessary, and no frivolous statements are made.
He is also provided with a duly certified true copy of the complete
policy with the relevant clauses and endorsements as actually attached
with the original policy issued to cover the vehicle at the material
time of accident.</p>
<h2 id="ii-drivers-licence">ii. Drivers Licence</h2>
<p>In case, it is observed that
driver was not duly licensed, the necessary information should be given
to the advocate. Though under Section 149 (2) of the MV Act, 1988,
insurance company has no liability, if the driver is not duly licensed,
the onus to prove that the driver was not holding a licence rests on
insurance company and this obligation is required to be discharged fully
to the satisfaction of the court. If a breach of a policy condition has
been observed, it should be brought to the notice of the Advocate to
enable him to take proper defense. Written Statement on behalf of
insurance company incorporating all defences available as enumerated
under Section 149 (2) of M.V. Act, 1988 should be properly filed.
Wherever necessary, when there is collusion between the insured and the
claimants or when the insured fails to defend the claim, the Company&rsquo;s
Advocate must be instructed to obtain the MACT&rsquo;s permission under
Section 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act to defend the claim on merits.</p>
<h2 id="iii-receipts-of-summon">iii. Receipts of summon</h2>
<p>All the intimations received from the owners,
immediately after the accident, should be properly kept in a separate
file and the same should be tagged with the file as and when summon is
received from the court. In case if it comes to the notice that there is
a reference of third party claim at the time of settlement of any own
damage claim, then all the papers including photo copies of Driving
Licence, Claim form, Survey report, Registration book, Permit, Load
Challan etc. should be kept in a separate file so that it can easily be
located when the summon from the court for the third party is served on
the company. If the owner submits the summons to office then a
Vakalatnama should be obtained from him along with Driving Licence and
documents related to the vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="iv-appointment-of-advocate">iv. Appointment of Advocate</h2>
<p>On receipt
of summon from the MACT, a competent Advocate from the panel of
advocates, should be engaged immediately and the claim should be entered
into the claim intimation Register and a file to be opened. In case
multiple claims arise out of one accident, the dealing office should
entrust all cases to the same advocate to defend all the cases so that
one file is created for all cases. In case policy relates to other
office, the copy of the claim petition along with the name of the
Advocate appointed should be sent to the policy issuing office to enable
them to maintain outstanding provision for the case in their books and
the copy of the policy should be collected from them along with
confirmation of Sec. 64 VB compliance.</p>
<h2 id="v-submission-of-documents-by-insured">v. Submission of documents by insured</h2>
<p>The insured should be asked in person or a registered A/D letter
should be sent to him requesting him to furnish all the vehicular
documents viz.</p>
<p>RC, Route permit, Load Challan and details of cause accident, Driver&rsquo;s
particulars along with copy of DL, FIR, Details of criminal prosecution
of driver, if initiated</p>
<p>If the policy particulars have been disclosed in the claim petition then
the policy should be immediately collected and the same should be
forwarded to the Advocate after retaining a photo copy in the file along
with Sec. 64 VB compliance confirmation. In case policy particulars have
not been disclosed in the claim petition an endeavour should be made to
contact the alleged owner of the vehicle, through registered letter and
followed by a personal call to ascertain the insurance particulars. 448</p>
<p>If the above endeavour is not successful then the dealing lawyer should
be advised to move an application for obtaining comprehensive ‗search
report&rsquo; after having details of documents filed by petitioner. The
copies of such documents are given to the insurer to trace insurance
particulars and expedite the process. On submission of search report by
the Advocate and on the basis of confirmation of the insurance and
coverage for insured vehicle in the said accident, the panel advocate
submits a „Say Report‟ to registrar. In case insurance is not accepted
or not confirmed „No Say Report‟ is submitted. If the above endeavour is
not successful then the dealing lawyer should be advised to file a
petition in the Tribunal for disclosing the insurance particulars by the
owner of the vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="vi-drafting-written-statement">vi. Drafting written statement</h2>
<p>Considering the nature of the case the same should be investigated immediately by the
dealing officer / investigator and the Investigation Report along with
other relevant documents should be sent to the Advocate for drafting
Written Statement. The following steps may be taken by the Advocate, as
the case may be: (a) To seek adjournment for filing written statement.
(b) To arrange filling disclosure petition if the policy particulars are
not available. (c) To prepare and submit a draft written statement
immediately for approval. (d) To file a petition for expunction of the
name of the company if the vehicle is not insured with us at the
material time of accident. The company should arrange to file a
certified copy of insurance policy along with its defence. The facts, if
known, should not be denied in the written statement as defence. The
Written Statement should not be prepared on total denial basis as it
prejudices the Tribunal against the insurer. The operating office should
be careful to include all specific defenses, such as (a) Breach of
policy conditions, (b) Non-renewal of policy, (c) Cancellation of policy
due to dishonour of the cheque, (d) Driver not holding valid driving
licence, (e) Defenses available under Section 149(2) in the written
statement, as no new facts can be pleaded at time of going in appeal.</p>
<p>On the basis of the Investigation Report and the Lawyer&rsquo;s report if it
is found that the liability of the company is not in doubt and the
defenses under Section 149(2) of the M.V. Act 1988 are not available, an
endeavour should be made to compromise the case as per guide schedule.
Where the insured / driver is set exparte, the company should apply to
the Court for taking over the insured&rsquo;s defence also by the company
under Sec 170. In case company takes over defense, its liability remains
as per Policy Document vis-a-vis not in excess of statutory liability.</p>
<h2 id="vii-regular-follow-up-action">vii. Regular follow-up action</h2>
<p>Regular follow-up action should be made
with the Advocate and on the dates of important hearing the dealing
officer of the company should be present in the Court. The dealing
office should advise the Advocate to arrange issuance of summons through
Tribunal to Driver, Owner and R.T.A. and any other authority as the case
may be. The Advocate should inform the developments of the case to the
appointing office from time to time and in case he fails to do so he
should be warned immediately and his indifferent action should be
intimated to the controlling Office. After the judgment is delivered by
the tribunal, an application for certified copy of judgment and award
should be made immediately.</p>
<h2 id="viii-no-fault-liability">viii. No Fault Liability</h2>
<p>According to the
provisions of the M.V. Act 1939 in case of Motor Accident, the owner is
only liable for negligence on proof of his vicarious liability for the
act of his servants. However, from 1.10.1982 the MV Act was amended and
a new section 92A was introduced known as No Fault liability. Currently
this amount of No Fault liability is Rs. 50,000/- and Rs. 25,000/- under
Sec. 140 of the new MV Act 1988. For making an award the tribunal has
got to only satisfy itself from the materials on record, that the
accident has arisen out of the use of the motor vehicle and the accident
has resulted in permanent disablement or death of a person where the
claim is made against the owner and insurer of the motor vehicle
involved in the accident or the claim is made in case of death of the
person by his legal heirs. The no fault liability award being an interim
award, should be immediately satisfied if the vehicle was covered during
the relevant period and if Sec. 64 VB is complied with.</p>
<h2 id="ix-payment-of-fault-liability-claims">ix. Payment of Fault Liability Claims</h2>
<p>Company must initiate action to
settle such claims either through Jald Rahat Yojna or Lok Adalats or
Direct negotiations with the claimant through DICC and RICC. Unless
conclusive proof of defences are available which would satisfy the
Courts there is no point in prolonging the case. Once an award is passed
it should be satisfied immediately on its pronouncement unless of course
decision is taken by the competent authority to file an appeal against
judgement and award. Before taking a decision it is essential to examine
the grounds on which such an appeal can be filed to ensure that a
substantial point of law is involved.</p>
<h2 id="x-settlement-of-award">x. Settlement of Award</h2>
<p>Since the supply of certified copy of the award is delayed by the Tribunals,
advocate should be advised to send an uncertified copy of the award
along with his opinion so that company may take immediate decision as to
filing of appeal or settlement of the award. Moreover, immediate
application for certified copy of award and judgment should be filed. If
the dealing advocate opines for filing of an appeal then the Operating
Office should send the file to Controlling Office with their
recommendation in the prescribed format along with complete file
containing claim petition, W/S, judgement, award and other papers. The
settlement of the award is to be made expeditiously in order to avoid
payment of penal interest. The competent authority should take
appropriate action, if without sufficient reason, penal interest due to
delay in satisfaction of the award is paid. The advocate should be
advised to apply for the certified copy of the award immediately and on
receipt of the same he should send the award forthwith to the dealing
office. If there are any lapses on the part of the advocate in taking
expeditious action in this regard it should be immediately brought to
the notice of the Regional Office for taking suitable action against the
lawyer. Immediately after depositing the awarded amount, Court
Satisfaction Order / Information Slip should be obtained confirming the
payment made to the Tribunal. The lawyer&rsquo;s fees should also be paid
within a reasonable time.</p>
<h2 id="xi-steps-to-be-taken-in-execution-cases">xi. Steps to be taken in Execution Cases</h2>
<p>Under Motor Vehicle Accident cases normally award is passed against insurance
company, sometimes in a very arbitrary manner. With the enactment of
M.V. Act 1988, the liability of the insurer has increased to unlimited
one. In such situation the insurer has got a very limited defence
available to avoid the enormous amount of award to be saddled upon them.</p>
<p>Appeal is being preferred in lieu of rarest cases by the insurer and
even in such situation there is impending danger of execution of award
which may get initiated any time. In case appeal is preferred, that step
alone, taken by the insurer, does not keep them in an immune position or
mere filing of appeal does not construe that the order of the MACT is
stayed automatically. There is no bar to initiate the execution of award
unless it is stayed by the appellate court under the procedure
prescribed for the purpose. In this connection M.V. Act 1988, Section
174 ―Where an amount is due from any person under an award the Claims
Tribunal may, on any application made to it by the person entitled to
the amount, issue a certificate for amount to the collector and the
collector shall proceed to recover the same in the same manner as an
arrear of land Revenue.‖ This means that the court passing the decree
shall make out a case for execution and direct the Collector to recover
as an arrear of Land Revenue. The Act does not permit MACT. to execute
its own decision. In most cases it has been experienced that MACT. court
goes to the extent of executing its own order in such case the objection
can be filed challenging the jurisdiction of the court. Under the spirit
of statute prescribed such action amounts to excessive exercise of power
not duly vested in them. Although there is contrary verdict expressed by
the court, it has been held to the context as under: ―Competence and
jurisdiction of Claims Tribunal to function as an executing court to
execute and enforce its award according to the procedure as provided
for, in order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure Rule 23 (3) not ultra
varies. Section 174 of 1988 Act stipulated that the Tribunal is a court
for all intents and purposes and has jurisdiction to execute an award.
Award is as executable by the Tribunal as a decree of a civil court.‖
When the matter is referred to Collector under Public Demands Recovery
Act, the Certificate Officer will cause the notice to be served upon the
Certificate Debtor in prescribed manner along with a copy of the
Certificate under Section 7 of the Public Demands Recovery Act. The
moment notice is served upon the insurer; the immediate step to be taken
by the Insurance Company is to file an objection under Section 9 of the
Act which provides for filing of petition denying liability, for an
objection under the act has to be filed in prescribed Form No. 4
appearing in Appendix Form mentioned therein. The said objection has to
be filed within one month of receipt of notice. Very often it has been
seen that the lawyers conducting the case at the Certificate state
simply seek adjournment on the oft repeated plea that the time be
granted for obtaining stay order from the Hon&rsquo;ble High Court as the
appeal has been preferred against the impugned order.</p>
<p>There might have been an appeal pending in the High Court along with a
prayer of stay under order 41 Rule of 5 of the code of Civil Procedure,
but even in that case to grant or not to grant stay is the prerogative
of High Court, which depends on the merit and exigency of the case and
it is highly improper to undertake the responsibility of any anticipated
order of the highest court of adjudication of the State. The company
should fight the case on merit supported with the averment that the
appeal has been filed and stay petition with a prayer to stall the
proceeding of execution, since appeal is there to be adjudicated.</p>
<h2 id="xii-stay-of-operation-of-award-during-the-pendency-of-appeal">xii. Stay of operation of award during the pendency of appeal</h2>
<p>In case stay of
operation of order is not been possible to be procured in time from the
appellate court the matter should be argued on merit with all defences
available on merit. Assuming that the Certificate case has been decided
against the certificate debtor the scope of Section 60 of the Act comes
as under: (a) An appeal from any original order made under this Act
shall lie:  If the order was made by an assistant Collector or a Deputy
Collector, or by a Certificate Officer not being the Collector &ndash; to the
Collector, or  If the order was made by the Collector, to the
Commissioner, (b) Every such appeal must be presented in case  Within
15 days, or in case  Within 30 days, from the date of the order Section
60 sub-section 5 provides ―Pending the decision of any appeal, execution
may be stayed if the appellate authority so directs, but not otherwise‖
under the aforesaid the Certificate debtor may apply for stay of
execution and can have the order accordingly. Suppose the appeal fails,
there is yet another remedy available to the judgement debtor and in
such situation the matter can be agitated under Revision jurisdiction of
the Act under Section 62: The Collector may revise any order passed by a
Certificate officer, Assistant Collector or Deputy Collector under this
Act. The Commissioner may revise any order passed by the Collector under
the Act, and the Board of Revenue may revise any order passed by a
Commissioner under the Act.</p>
<p>There is provision of Review under the Act Section 63 Review: ―Any order
passed under this Act may, after notice to all persons, interested, be
reviewed by the officer who made the order, or by his successor-in
office, on account of mistake or error either in the making of the
certificate or in the course of any proceeding under the Act.‖ There is
yet another alternate and efficacious remedy available under the act
under the heading reference to civil court under Section 43 of the Act
further provides the certificate debtor may, at any time within six
months: (a) From the serving upon him of the notice required by Section
7, or (b) If he files, in accordance with Section 9, a petition denying
liability from the date of the determination of the petition, or, (c) If
he appeals in accordance with Section 60, from an order passed under
Section 10-from the date of the decision of such appeal, Bring a suit in
a civil court to have the Certificate cancelled or modified, and for any
further course consequential relief to which he may be entitled.
Analysing the various provisions enumerated under the Act there is an
elaborate remedy to exhaust in order to seek the redressal of grievances
in case any exigency so arises. If on any occasion the order of
attachment of assets has been passed and the operation of such order is
on anvil, the judgment debtor can ask for some accommodation as to seek
sanction from their higher authority as they might be lacking power to
dispose the certificate debt at a time. Assuming no such accommodation
is feasible the judgment debtor can say since the assets belongs to
Government of India comprising several valuable securities of public at
large so they are not authorised be a party or witness to the execution
unless and until they are duly authorised for the purpose by their
higher authority. In that case they can refuse to accept or sign over
the inventory prepared for the purpose. In case of refusal of the same
the executing agent will have to obtain fresh requisite under the
circumstances and a new lease of life can be had for the time being to
avoid any untoward incident in the matter. Besides this, the alternative
remedy under appellate jurisdiction is there to do needful under the
procedure prescribed in law and the same may be pressed with all sense
of urgency in warranting conditions.</p>
