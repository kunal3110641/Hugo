<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>In this chapter you will learn about frauds in TP claims and frauds in
Motor Insurance. You will also know about the types of frauds, how to
underwrite frauds and the issues to be audited.</p>

<li>Frauds in TP Claims</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Third Party claims settlements are a drag on an insurer&rsquo;s
profitability. They form the highest amount of claims among all
departments. Whilst it is not denied that these settlements are a social
obligation, it must also be ensured that individuals / claimants do not
take undue advantage of the provisions of the law to enhance personal
wealth. The very nature of these claims leaves them open to fraudulent
practices.</p>
<h2 id="a-reason-for-claims-occurrence">a) Reason for Claims Occurrence</h2>
<p>The time span between the
date of accident and the filing of the case or receipt of summons from
the Court by the insurers renders the information open to manipulation.
Section 158(6) of the MV Act 1988 requires the Officer-in-charge of the
Police Station to forward the FIR to the insurers and Claims Tribunal
having jurisdiction within thirty days. Claimant&rsquo;s lack of knowledge on
their entitlement leaves them at the mercy of Advocates and other
Agencies. Advocates take up such matters with a ―No gain no fee‖ concept
and may therefore, be tempted to manipulation.</p>
<h2 id="b-fraud-management">b) Fraud Management</h2>
<p>Fraud management is essential to ensure that only genuine claims are settled.
Some of the measures that can be adopted are documentary proofs of
accident details: Photographs, Witness statements, Identities of
claimants and witnesses, Examination of the authorities concerned with
the case e.g. doctor treating the accident victim to depose on the
nature or extent of injury,  RTA authority to depose on the vehicle and
driver&rsquo;s documents,  Identification of claimants by concerned police
official</p>
<p>i.Appointment of investigator: It is essential to appoint an investigator
to collect facts, probe the documents and details issued by the Hospital
in Medico Legal Cases (MLC) where the victim was first admitted /
treated.</p>
<p>ii. Photograph of victim: Preferably, photograph of victim may also be
obtained duly certified by the attending doctor. iii. Panchnama and
Seizure report detailing accident site and cause of accident and the
documents taken in the custody by the police viz. Policy copy, Driving
Licence, Registration Certificate etc. 494</p>
<p>iv. Identity of witnesses to accident, PM / Inquest report for date
time of accident, age of victim and cause of death. v. The Motor Vehicle
Inspectors (MVI) report on the damages to the vehicle; owner, driver,
cause of accident and the charge sheet of involvement should be obtained
and studied. If documents infer fraud they should be provided as
evidence and Written Statement (WS) should vigorously pursue the matter.
A police complaint of fraud should also be filed to support the
contention. The insurers representing Advocate should be advised to
incorporate all defenses to deal with the case and to emphasis these
fraudulent aspects. Here it must be emphasised that the insurers must
follow-up with the advocate to ensure that the WS is filed as per their
instructions and defended by the advocate appropriately.</p>

Identification of Fraud: Thorough knowledge of MACT cases, MV Act,
Criminal Procedure Acts, IPC and document related in connection thereof
should be there to detect the fraud. Some examples are: i.</p>
<p>FIR provides information about the cause and nature of accident,
negligence, vehicle no., name of the driver, place of the accident, name
of the victims of accident, names of the hospital where the victims were
first admitted, name of eye witnesses.</p>
<p>i.. Accidents register gives information about the above facts.</p>
<p>i.. Seizure memo gives first information about the existence of policy,
name of the driver and also the driving licence seized along with
vehicle records.</p>
<p>iv. Panchnama / site sketch plan at the place of accident gives
information about cause of accident, and negligence part. v. Inquest
report gives information about the deceased person, time of accident,
time of identification of dead body, and outer marks of injury, hurt,
etc. vi. Post Mortem Report gives information about time of death, age
of deceased and cause of accidental death. vi. . Statement of witness
given before the Police Authority in accordance with section 161(3) of
Cr. PC gives information on the persons involved in criminal cases where
as, stock witnesses are examined in MACT trials. vii. . Report of Motor
Vehicle Inspector informs about the damages to the vehicle, with date of
accident and inspection. It can also be inferred from there, if vehicle
had some mechanical fault. It gives information about the name of the
owner and the driver. ix. Charge sheet informs about the negligence of
the driver, in addition to giving other information like vehicle
involved persons dead or injured, etc. x. Findings in a criminal case
such as non-involvement of vehicle or nonaccident cases. Effective
investigation: The perusal of above-mentioned documents and probing mind
of MACT officer will be able to detect if any fraud is involved. Apart
from these, effective investigation should be arranged for the
corroboration of the vital facts and to dig out additional information
to ascertain the truth. For effective investigation following norm
should be followed: i. The investigator must visit the place of
occurrence of accident to ascertain the place of accident / details of
accident / victims etc. It is preferable that this part of investigation
is conducted immediately after the information of accident is made
available through any source such as newspaper etc. i.</p>
<p>. Details of information in relation to victims and claimants should be
ascertained by the investigator from the residence/ dwellings of the
victim/ claimants and from the neighbours of this person. As proof
MOTOR INSURANCE 501</p>
<p>the investigator should bring recent photographs of these persons, as
well as the persons whose statements he obtains in support of the facts.
Weightage should be given to the documentary evidence. i.</p>
<p>. Investigator should specifically collect the details of the offending
vehicle, the driver at the time of accident, owner, RC particulars,
insurance details, so that any fraud in connection with aforesaid should
be detected at an early stage.</p>
<p>iv. The investigator must bring a copy of Medical Leave Certificate,
Hospital record where the victim allegedly had been reported/admitted.
In addition to it he must bring information if any other hospital or
clinic was situated near the place of accident. If yes, then the reason
for admitting victims to a distant hospital. Copy of prescription,
discharge certificate, bills of purchase, etc must be collected. v.
Identification of fraud is also possible if investigation is arranged by
introducing modern technology like videography, audiography, etc., so
that fraud is proved conclusively. vi. Own damage claim file should be
connected with MACT claim file for verification of facts and detection
of frauds.</p>

<p>i.. In cases of frauds connected with major accidents, necessary
assistance may be invited from the media whose first time reporting
might be used as evidence.</p>
<p>iv. The time has come when the leading investigators should be
appointed in each District nationwide, who will work directly under the
supervision of controlling offices. They should also be instructed that
they will personally visible all accidents in Districts. If any case is
related to the company they will immediately commence their
investigation in the matter and shall collect all particulars /
documents / information from various statutory authorities, hospitals,

<h2 id="e-false-and-fabricated-claims">e) False and Fabricated Claims</h2>
<p>In (2007 ACJ 2824) it was held that
minor discrepancies in the FIR would not prejudice the sustainability of
the claim petition. However it has been held repeatedly that if there is
inconsistency in the version of the accident, the dismissal of the claim
petition is in order. There was a delay of 6 months in filing the FIR
and the evidence of the so- called eyewitness was not trustworthy. The
dismissal of the claim petition was upheld in appeal. In a fabricated
claim by an injured policeman, the claim was dismissed with directions
to Police to take action against the claimants / policeman. In spite of
the driver being convicted on admission of guilt, the claim was
dismissed as false.</p>
<h2 id="f-power-to-recall-by-tribunals">f) Power to Recall by Tribunals</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court
had adverted to tainted claims in [(United India Insurance Co. Ltd.,
vs. Rajendra Singh) 2000 ACJ 1032] and held that the Claims Tribunals
had the inherent power to review / recall awards which are alleged to be
tainted with fraud. It was held that fraud and justice can never go
together and no insurer can be deprived of his right to seek and recall
the award, which is alleged to be so trained. There were a couple of
claims lodged by father-son duo alleging involvement of an insured
vehicle. Four months after the awards were passed in lakhs, there was a
visitor to the insurer who produced a document to demonstrate that the
claims were fudged and fabricated. On appeal to Supreme Court, it was
held that the insurer was entitled to move the Claims Tribunal under
Secs.151 &amp; 152 CPC., irrespective of whether or not the power of review
was vested statutorily with the Claims Tribunal. The Supreme Court held
that it had the inherent power from its very Constitution to deal with
such allegations of fraud. The remedy of appeal was an unrealistic one
since the insurer would obviously be unaware of the elements of fraud
while contesting. Any appeal would be futile as there would neither be a
pleading nor evidence. Therefore, it was held that review/recall of the
award was the proper remedy. There is yet another decision reported in
[(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., vs. R. Mani) 2000 ACJ 247 (Mad)] on
similar lines holding that the Claims Tribunals of such kind had the
concomitant power to recall awards tainted by fraud from its very
Constitution. But Tamil Nadu had the unique distinction of providing a
dubious lead in having a major share of such tainted claims, which has
now culminated in an order by the High Court wherein the complaints of
insurance companies have been directed to be entrusted to Central Bureau
of Investigation, New Delhi, for re-investigation. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>It appears that the menace of such false and fabricated claims is not
unique to the genius of Tamil Nadu. Such claims do exist all over the
country and are real menaces crying to be dealt with to safeguard the
purity of this welfare jurisdiction. The orders dated 1/3/2006 is now
pending before the Apex Court in SLP at the instance of State of Tamil
Nadu and hopefully it will look at it in a the national perspective.</p>
<h2 id="g-false-premises">g) False Premises</h2>
<p>It is not as if fabrication is only in falsely
implicating insured vehicles in motor accidents where the vehicle is
unidentified. An accident was originally reported to Police as a
skidding of a scooter leading to a fall. After six months the mishap was
converted to a collision between the scooter and an insured. The High
Court came down heavily on the claim as a fraud and fabrication. It was
held that appreciation of evidence should be in proper context and the
earliest version should be taken to be truthful as lapse of time enables
parties to fabricate the facts. It was held that sympathy for the
victims should not be misplaced. The claim petition was held fit to be
dismissed as false and fabricated. It was held to be a fabrication based
on the discrepancies in documentary evidence and the oral depositions.</p>
<h2 id="h-non-motor-cases-fixed-as-motor-accidents">h) Non-motor Cases Fixed as Motor Accidents</h2>
<p>But there are instances of
persons dying from AIDs, Jaundice, being falsely claimed to have died
from motor accidents. In a recent case, murder was converted to motor
accident. The insurer was held not liable [2008 ACJ 113 (Kant)].
Injuries suffered due to falling from a tree or heights are fixed as
motor accidents. There is willing complicity of the owners of vehicle,
drivers, police personnel and medical professionals too to fabricate a
claim. In a case of fraud it would be open to the aggrieved to file a
writ petition since fraud would vitiate any judgment intended to do
justice. [(New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. MACT, Gauhati) 2007 ACJ
1360 (Gau)]. It would suffice to record a couple of them and the events
leading up to the orders of the High Court, Madras directing
re-investigation by CBI. In 1996 there was an accident in Tiruppur area
of Tamil Nadu involving a Maruti car in which some persons were
travelling when it hit a palmyrah tree. The FIR was registered at the
instance of a passenger on the car, stating the manner of accident as
the car having lost control and hitting a palmyrah tree. Six months down
the line, police investigation suggests that one Mr. Kittan had come to
the Police Station to relate a conversation he had overheard between a
driver and a cleaner of goods vehicle, at a teashop on the highway.</p>
<p>According to it the driver of the Truck had laughed aloud and related to
the cleaner that six months earlier there was an accident involving a
Maruti car and the injured passengers were unaware of the involvement of
the truck. One Good Samaritan Mr. Kittan had noted the vehicle number.
This event was related to Police authorities on a Friday and the
following Monday morning the driver / owner of the vehicle was arrested
and in a jiffy chargesheeted, they confessed to guilt and were convicted
to pay fine before a criminal Court. Thereupon, 5 motor accident claim
petitions were filed before the Claims Tribunal seeking compensation
from the owner of the vehicle and the insurer of it.</p>
<h2 id="i-insurers-right-to-challenge-conviction-on-abuse-of-process-of-law">i) Insurers Right to Challenge Conviction on Abuse of Process of Law</h2>
<p>The insurer is not a
party to the Criminal Court proceedings. Though Criminal Court verdicts
are not binding on Claims Tribunals, a plea of guilt would stop the
driver and insurer from disputing otherwise in a claim proceeding. In
the criminal jurisprudence insurers right to challenge such conviction
on abuse of process of law was unheard of and not reported till only
some years back. The insurer chose to move the High Court by way of
Civil Revision Petition in 1998 challenging the order of conviction of
driver/owner on admission before the Criminal Court under Article 227 as
having arisen out of an abuse of process of law. The petition was
admitted and stays on the claim petitions were granted. Ultimately, it
culminated in an order of the High Court directing the Crime Branch in
Tamil Nadu to conduct re-investigation of the closed criminal action in
the light of the evidence submitted by the insurer that the claim was a
fabricated one [in (National Insurance Co. Ltd., vs. K. Nandabalan)
2005 (2) LW 439.]. This course of action was probably the only one of
its kind embarked on by an insurer until [(Rajendra Singhs Case) 2000
ACJ 1032] opened their eyes to the possibility of recall of the award.
Thereafter, in similar circumstances of fudging in a claim, the insurer
moved the High Court under Article 226 seeking for re-investigation of a
closed criminal case, by the higher echelons of the Police establishment
and to file an additional charge sheet, if necessary, under Sec.173 (8)
of Cr.P.C. A writ of mandamus was issued by the High Court to the Police
authorities. The authorities failed to comply with the directions and
contempt petition arose there from. During pendency of the contempt
proceedings the Police Authorities filed a report confirming that the
allegations of the insurer on false and fabricated claims appeared to be
correct and that the accident might have been a stage-managed one. By
that time it was widely reported in the media that in Namakkal belt of
Tamil Nadu there were scores of such false and fabricated claims and
huge loot was going in the name of welfare jurisdiction. IC-72 MOTOR
INSURANCE</p>
<p>Claims unrelated to motor accidents were manipulated as motor accident
claims and compensation sought for in lakhs and even crores.</p>
<h2 id="complaints-of-insurers">j) Nandabalans Case Constituting a Central Agency to consider the
complaints of insurers</h2>
<p>Taking the cue from this wide reportage, the
insurer moved an application before the High Court seeking for creation
of a re- investigative mechanism with the Crime Branch of Tamil Nadu
Police, as distinct from the local police establishment. It was pointed
out that the local Police establishment, medical men and lawmen were in
the thick of the scam and it was widespread. The State Public Prosecutor
was called by the High Court, Madras who appeared and confirmed the scam
in all its manifestations. It was recorded that the State was equally
inclined to expose the scamsters and proceed against them. The High
Court, thereupon, delivered a verdict constituting a Central Agency at
Chennai to consider the complaints of insurers with regard to false and
fabricated claims. The order [in (National Insurance Company Ltd.,
Coimbatore vs. K. Nandabalan, 2005 (2) LW 439)], in full is a unique
decision of its kind, fully revealing the goings-on.</p>
<h2 id="k-reinvestigations-closed-as-mistake-of-fact">k) Reinvestigations closed as Mistake of Fact</h2>
<p>It was true that during the proceedings and in
the immediate aftermath of the decision, there were a host of withdrawal
of claims fearing criminal action. Insurers were able to save crores of
rupees. But some months down the line, it was found that the scamsters
had devised ways and means to get over this hiccup. The complaints of
insurers for reinvestigation were being closed by the dozen, on the
premise of mistake of fact. The insurers were in no position to defend
the motor accidents claims, based on fraud, and equally challenged the
criminal Court verdicts on other fronts. The High Court by orders of its
own kind, on the national level, dated 1/3/2006 directed to constitute a
Central Agency headed by the Deputy Inspector of Police. CB-CID, Chennai
for the purpose of looking into all the complaints relating to bogus
claims before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal filed, based on
fabricated records. The course of action initiated by the Central Agency
was not only slow and tardy but after the initial enthusiasm, on the
realization that a sincere reinvestigation may expose fellow police
officials, there was an effort to tone down the manner of investigation.
It is alleged that the officers to whom reinvestigation was entrusted
are totally indifferent to the serious nature of the crimes involved.</p>
<p>Even in such of those few cases where a fraud was exposed and charge
sheets were filed, it was found that the charge sheets were so
formulated and proceedings manipulated so as to enable the accused to
escape the wrath of law. In a large number of cases, notwithstanding the
glaring fraud and fabricated documents available on record, the Central
Agency has totally disregarded and ignored the vital links and instead
closed the complaints as mistake of facts. The statistics as on

<p>238.40 179.38 313.08 692.75</p>
<p>It is stated that 25% of the above claims were found to be tainted by
fraud and fabrication. Further, in order to demonstrate that
re-investigation by CB-CID was not sincere and diligent and their
closure of the complaints as mistake of facts was contrived and
deliberate several instances from other Police Stations were also cited.
CBI submitted before the High Court, Madras that they did not have
adequate manpower, infrastructure to handle so many complaints and
accordingly, they have been entrusted only with 23 complaints till date.
By orders dated 10.11.2006, the High Court had directed the Central
Government to respond as to whether an Insurance Fraud Bureau, like
those existing in UK, and US could be created in India. The Central
Government has since filed an Affidavit expressing inability on the
ground that already an IRDA Committee and the Law Commission have found
it not feasible. Hence it would appear that IFB in India may remain an
unrealized dream. The Central Government has suggested that just as
banks are taking care of their claims; it was for the vigilance
department of the respective Insurance Companies to handle it, enlisting
the services of the local State Police, as law and order was a state
subject. The said proceedings are pending before the High Court, of
Madras and the last word on it cannot be said to have been uttered yet.</p>

<li>Issues to be Audited</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The insurers make all out efforts towards
continuous improvement of quality in the operations of Third Party
Claims Department. Besides Internal Audit, insurers have also initiated
quality assurance exercise on a regular basis to review the existing
claims and make adequate provision. Due to prevailing state of affairs
the work load in the operating offices has enormously increased. The
pressure to handle claims is to the tune of over 1000 cases per officer,
which leaves a lot of gaps in efficient working of the department. IC-72
MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>The audit teams are required to test that outstanding provision made for
third party claims are adequate. Further the teams have to look into the
aspect of timely completion of files. i. Whether policy copy and 64 VB
confirmations immediately?</p>
<p>were</p>
<p>received</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Whether vehicle-related documents are verified routinely?</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Whether investigators used are giving quality reports and whether they
obtain statements on affidavit and make themselves available for
evidence in Court of law to protect the company&rsquo;s interest?</p>
<p>In order to look into various audit issues it is necessary to study
common processing defects in third party claims settlement.</p>
<h2 id="a-common-processing-defects">a) Common Processing Defects</h2>
<p>The service of summons along with the copy of the
plaint to insurance company is the first step in the processing of third
party claims. The copy of the plaint must be thoroughly studied since it
gives a fair idea not only of the applicants and the claimants and / or
victims e.g., age, occupation, income, family background etc., but also
the circumstances of the accident. There may be several claims where
cases filed may not have resulted out of vehicular accidents.
Investigation is the second important step to be instituted immediately
on receipt of plaint. The Investigator should invariably collect facts,
documents, and statements as here under: i. Certified copy of police
papers viz. F.I.R. Panchnama, Station Diary entry form 54, Charge sheet
as well as statements recorded by the police. i.</p>
<p>. Driving Licence with the certificate of concerned RTO (Xerox copy to
be avoided)</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Insurance particulars of vehicle, R. C. Book, Fitness Certificate and
Permit (if applicable), Load Challan.</p>
<p>iv. Facts about claimant and / or victim, e.g., age, proof of income,
Financial Status &amp; information from neighbours and other relevant
details like previous illness, injury, hospitalisation and related
medical accounts / record including Bed Side Ticket, test reports,
prescriptions etc.</p>
<p>v. Injury, disability certificate, Confirmation from treating hospital
/ Doctor. vi. The insured could also be informed by investigator to
cooperate as per the provision of the Section 134 (C) of 1988 Act. As
such many a time the spot statements given to police and facts mentioned
in the plaint vary due to an afterthought by the claimants, e.g., the
vehicle responsible for accident being uninsured, blame is shifted to
another vehicle, FIR is lodged late, the name of the driver is changed,
the Driving Licence does not authorise the holder of licence to drive
that type of vehicle, the copy of Driving Licence submitted in OD claim
is different. The investigator must also look into and verify
classification of vehicle to ascertain whether the vehicle was being
used for the purpose it was insured, in reference to Notification # SO
451 (E) dated 19-06-1992 (Annexure1) specifying Transport or Non
Transport vehicles and Notification # G.S.R. 400 (E) dated 11-05- 2002
categorising motor vehicles as per their seating &amp; luggage carrying
capacity. The statements with regard to injury must be crosschecked with
police papers to rule out any exaggeration of facts. The Advocate may be
instructed to scrutinise the Disability Certificate for the purpose of
getting interim compensation u/s 140. If necessary, the Advocate should
be asked to request the Court to summon the Doctor as a witness and an
affidavit of Insurance Company&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Surgeon may also be filed
highlighting the discrepancies in the Certificate submitted by the
applicant. The advocate may also ask Claims Tribunal to seek affidavit
from the attending Doctor to bring out the truth. Sometimes more than
one vehicle is involved and one insurance company may pay their share of
No Fault Liability compensation u/s 140. Later it may happen that the
insurer who had paid the NFL is exonerated of their liability at the
stage of final award. In such a situation the attention of the other
insurer must be asked to deduct the amount paid by the other insurer and
reimburse the same to them so as to make sure that the applicant does
not receive more than the actual award.</p>
<p>i. Receipt of summons</p>
<p>The common processing defect at the time of service of summons to the
insurer is that no date stamp is affixed by the insurers office on the
face of summons received, which can be vital evidence of late service of
summons. The summons are neither filed with file number, case number and
claim number on the same day, nor entered in TP claims register or
Genysis same day, resulting in misplaced summons.</p>
<p>Further the summonses are not handed over to the advocate immediately,
delaying the timely filing of proper written statement; improper written
statement on general denial basis is filed in the Claims Tribunal
hurriedly. The Underwriting Office is not requested immediately for
Certified Policy copy and advance premium payment compliance certificate
under Section 64 VB of Insurance Act 1938, resulting in lack of updated
data when required.</p>
<h2 id="ii-receipt-of-response-from-underwriting-office">ii. Receipt of response from underwriting office</h2>
<p>The Advocate is not informed immediately about the policy &amp; premium details
causing the liability of the company being wrongly denied or admitted in
the written statement. (a) First hearing: No application is submitted
immediately on receipt of summons by the panel Advocate in the Claims
Tribunal for filing of police records, PM report etc. This leads to
pleading of the case with defective arguments / defective defenses being
raised in regard to gratuitous passenger, invalid driving licence,
extent of disability, proof of income, age etc. culled out from the
investigation report. Further, application under Section 170 is not
filed despite nonrepresentation / collusion by the insured. This results
in the insurer losing the rights under Section 149(2) to use all grounds
for defence, which are otherwise available to the insured. (b) Receipt
of investigation report: The case is not handed over for investigation
with proper brief immediately to the investigator resulting in first or
subsequent hearing dates being missed. Further, it results in the
insured&rsquo;s Advocate filing improper pleadings in written statement and
putting forth improper arguments both on liability and quantum fixation.
(c) Hearing stage: A regular interaction with the advocate is essential
to ensure correct defences being taken. Lack of regular interaction with
the advocate during the hearing stage leads to defects in defence, and
no timely correction is possible later. (d) After the tribunal‟s
judgement: The advocates do not notify immediately about the final order
pronounced by the MACT. A Certified copy of the award is not obtained
immediately entailing unnecessary interest liability. At times awards
are not satisfied in time either due to collusion with claimants, when
the market interests are low as compared to interest awarded by courts
or due to sheer carelessness resulting in accumulation of avoidable
interest and legal costs and possibility of default in payment.</p>
<p>This causes execution petitions with arrest warrants or seizure of
Insurers accounts and custody of money by the courts. Sometimes the
decision on whether the award is satisfactory or if there is need to go
in for appeal against it is not taken within the limitation period. This
results in avoidable petitions for condoning delay and even rejection of
the same.</p>
<h2 id="iii-appellate-court">iii. Appellate court</h2>
<p>At times, unnecessary appeals are pursued
e.g., application under Section 170 has neither been filed nor
permission taken from the Claims Tribunal to contest on all the grounds.
Similarly appeals made on quantum are not tenable and at times lower
amounts to be defended are offset by legal and likely interest costs.
Sometimes hurriedly drafted appeals on improper grounds weaken the
defences resulting in failure in appeal with enhancement in interest
liability and legal costs to insurers.</p>
<h2 id="iv-scope-and-purport-of-tribunal">iv. Scope and purport of tribunal</h2>
<p>As regards the scope and purport of Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1988, the Claims Tribunal is not only entitled to determine the
amount of claim from the insurer, owner or driver of the vehicle jointly
or severally, but also adjudicate on the dispute between the insurer and
the owner or driver of the vehicle involved in the accident, in so far
as it can be resolved by the Claims Tribunal in such proceedings.</p>

<p>Whether the method of computing outstanding provision is incorrect?</p>
<p>i.. Why some of the files are incomplete (pertaining, for example, to the
following aspects): (a) 64 VB confirmation not received from outstation
policy issuing offices (b) Vehicular documents not verified (c)
Investigators not available to verify outstation addresses (d) Driver is
no longer in service of transporters to avail verification of DL (e)
Record keeping in settling office is unsystematic. (f) Xerox copies of
Cover notes do not bear office rubber stamp (g) Revised address list of
offices with present and old office code not available (h) Neglecting
orphan claims</p>
<p>i.. Claims paid through inter office accounts are not reflected in TP
claims paid / intimation register in the year of payment affecting
correctness of</p>
<p>incentive payments to development officers due to paid claims being
shown as inadequate outstanding provisions. iv. Attachment orders need
be examined as to the causes which led to the serious situation. System
deficiency should be identified and panel advocate should be asked to
explain. v. Number of TP claims registered is too large vis-a-vis
personnel earmarked to handle claims effectively. vi. Quality assurance
teams must examine large claims and claims outstanding for over three
years to initiate appropriate action in order to expedite settlement.</p>
<h2 id="c-treatment-of-orphan-claims">c) Treatment of Orphan Claims</h2>
<p>These are third party claims where no policy
details are available. Sometimes, Claims Tribunals serve notice only on
the Insurance Company and no claim petition is received, then such cases
are registered as Orphan Claims and a separate list is kept of such
claims. Suitable standing provision is made in the claim register
immediately. However, these provisions do not form a part of the
Divisions outstanding claim provision. Efforts are made by insurers to
trace the policy details through investigator, panel advocate, and
petitioners etc. In some cases they may belong to a series of cases
pertaining to a single accident. If the details are received then
suitable entry is to be made in the Claims Register, policy particulars
including Section 64 VB of Insurance Act 1938, compliance is procured
through the concerned underwriting office and sent to panel advocate. It
is absolutely necessary that an advocate is appointed immediately on
receipt of notice without for the policy details as otherwise the case
may be decided ex-parte. Sometimes the underwriting office receives
summons without a petitions copy. In that case the first thing to be
checked is whether such a case was already registered. This could happen
because sometimes the Claims Tribunal sends one copy of the summons by
registered post and another by hand delivery. If a case already exists,
then one must make sure that it has been entrusted to an advocate
already. If no particulars are available, then the case is registered as
an orphan claim. Orphan claims are those claims where policy particulars
are not available despite all efforts by insurance company who has been
served the summons. This gives rise to doubt that the policy may have
seen issued by some other office or insurer. It may also happen that
there is no insurance at all for the vehicle causing accident and the
insurance company is made respondent just for the sake of getting the
case admitted in a Claims Tribunal. 514</p>
<p>The panel advocate in such a case is asked to move Claims Tribunal to
seek all available particulars, in relation to this case. The Advocate
is required to initially move an application to obtain comprehensive
search report having details with documents filed by petitioner. On
submission of search report by the Advocate and on the basis of
confirmation of the insurance and coverage for insured vehicle in the
said accident, the panel Advocate submits a Say Report to the Court
Registrar. In case insurance is not accepted or not confirmed No Say
Report is submitted. The available details are given to the investigator
for obtaining further details of the accident and related documents. If
policy details remain unknown even after investigation, the claim would
remain as an orphan claim in our books. O/s provision will be made for
such claims and the statutory auditors will also examine it. However,
one third (1/3rd) of the provision are added to the figure of
outstanding provision of motor claims in our final accounts towards such
orphan claims. i.Tax on Interest Portion of Compensation: The insurers maintained that
interest was paid on the amount awarded as compensation because of
delayed payment and ordered by the Claims Tribunal, and if TDS was
applied, it was the beneficiaries who would be put to great loss, and in
view of that, companies were not deducting tax so far. The High Court of
Madras has ruled that insurers engaged in Motor Insurance business are
bound to deduct income tax at source (TDS) on interest paid on
compensation awarded by MACT in respect of claims under Section 194-A of
Income-tax Act.</p>
<p>Was their non-deduction of TDS for the past period wrong and were they
liable to pay the said amount? The petitioner, National Insurance Co.
Ltd., a Government of India undertaking, contended that Section 194-A
had since been amended with effect from June 1, 2003; and they were
deducting TDS on interest payable on the compensation. Referring to
non-deduction of income tax on compensation for the earlier period, the
petitioner submitted that the Central Board of Direct Taxes, through
their circular dated September 5, 2003 clarified that no deduction of
tax at source need be made in cases where the interest awarded on
compensation did not exceed Rs. 50,000/-. Mr. Justice K. Chandru, who
heard the petition, said there was no escape from liability for
deducting tax on interest on compensation. The Income-tax Department had
said that if the petitioner sent any representation in this matter, it
would always be received and will be given due attention.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-2">Test Yourself 2</h2>
<p>As regards the scope and purport of of the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988, the Claims Tribunal is entitled to determine the
amount of claim from the insurer, owner or driver of the vehicle jointly
or severally. I. Section 163 II. Section 168 III. Section 158 IV.
Section 161</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>a) Frauds in TP claims: Whilst it is not denied that Motor
accident Third party settlements are a social obligation, it must also
be ensured that individuals / claimants do not take undue advantage of
the provisions of the law to enhance personal wealth. b) Section 158(6)
of the MV Act requires the Officer-in-charge of the Police Station to
forward the FIR to the insurers and Claims Tribunal having jurisdiction
within thirty days. c) Fraud management is essential to ensure only
genuine claims are settled. Some of the steps taken in fraud management
include: i. Appointment of investigator i . Photograph of victim ii. .
Panchnama and Seizure report iv. Identity of witness v. The Motor
Vehicle Inspectors (MVI) report d) Wrongful gain is the gain by unlawful
means, of property, to which the person so gaining is not legally
entitled. Wrongful loss is the loss by unlawful means, of property, to
which the person losing it is legally entitled. e) Section 464 of IPC
provides that a person is said to make a false document, who dishonestly
or fraudulently makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of
document or who, without lawful authority, dishonestly, fraudulently, by
cancellation of otherwise, alters a document in any material part
thereof or who makes a false document, which dishonestly or fraudulently
causes any person to sign, seal, execute or alter. f) Types of fraud in
Motor Insurance include: i. Conversion of Non-Road Traffic Accidents i .
Conversion of Medical Cases for Wrongful Gain i i. Frauds in Road
Accidents iv. Multiple cases g) At the time of underwriting, when cover
is given knowingly about the occurrence. If cover is not available, then
by arranging forged cover. h) Identification of Fraud: Thorough
knowledge of MACT cases, MV Act, Criminal Procedure Acts, IPC and
document related in connection thereof should be there to detect the
fraud.</p>
<p>i) Effective investigation: The perusal of documents and probing mind
of MACT officer will be able to detect if any fraud is involved. Apart
from these, effective investigation should be arranged for the
corroboration of the vital facts and to dig out additional information
to ascertain the truth. j) Methods of Detection of underwriting fraud in
early stage: i. The investigation report i . The seizure memo ii. . 64
VB Compliance Certificate iv. The copy of cover produced by the
applicant in MACT in support of the claim v. Any complaint received in
the office k) Frauds Committed with Internal Support: The cases falling
under close proximity must be reported to the controlling office
immediately with all documents as prescribed by the guidelines. l)
Frauds Committed by Outsiders: FIR should be lodged before the competent
police authority. In case police authority does not take cognizance of
it, the complaint should be made to the judicial authority. m)
Preventive Management of Fraud Cases: In extreme cases the practice of
issuance of cover note should be abolished. It would be appropriate to
consider functioning of non-TP offices. Also where there are rampant
cases of fraud related to the underwriting, the office should be closed
/ staff should be rotated and all facilitating personnel must be
reviewed / changed n) Power to Recall by Claims Tribunals: The Supreme
Court had adverted to tainted claims in [(United India Insurance Co.
Ltd., vs. Rajendra Singh) 2000 ACJ 1032] and held that the Claims
Tribunals had the inherent power to review / recall awards which are
alleged to be tainted with fraud. It was held that fraud and justice can
never go together and no insurer can be deprived of his right to seek
and recall the award, which is alleged to be so trained. o)
Reinvestigations closed as Mistake of Fact: It was true that during the
proceedings and in the immediate aftermath of the decision, there were a
host of withdrawal of claims fearing criminal action. Insurers were able
to save crores of rupees. But some months down the line, it was found
that the scamsters had devised ways and means to get over this hiccup.
p) Issues to be audited: The insurers make all out efforts towards
continuous improvement of quality in the operations of Third Party
Claims Department. Besides Internal Audit, insurers have also initiated
quality assurance exercise on a regular basis to review the existing
claims and make adequate provision.</p>
<p>Receipt of summons: The common processing defect at the time of service
of summons to the insurer is that no date stamp is affixed by the
insurers office on the face of summons received, which can be vital
evidence of late service of summons. The summons are neither filed with
file number, case number and claim number on the same day, nor entered
in TP claims register or Genysis same day, resulting in misplaced
summons. q) Scope and purport of tribunal: As regards the scope and
purport of Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the Claims
Tribunal is not only entitled to determine the amount of claim from the
insurer, owner or driver of the vehicle jointly or severally, but also
adjudicate on the dispute between the insurer and the owner or driver of
the vehicle involved in the accident, in so far as it can be resolved by
the Claims Tribunal in such proceedings. r) Internal Audit Issues in
Third Party Claims Settlement: Some important issues in third party
claims settlement are listed below: i. Whether the method of computing
outstanding provision is incorrect? i . Why some of the files are
incomplete ii. . Claims paid through inter office accounts are not
reflected in TP claims paid / intimation register in the year of payment
affecting correctness of incentive payments to development officers due
to paid claims being shown as inadequate outstanding provisions. iv.
Attachment orders need be examined as to the causes which led to the
serious situation. System deficiency should be identified and panel
advocate should be asked to explain. v. Number of TP claims registered
is too large vis--vis personnel earmarked to handle claims effectively.
vi. Quality assurance teams must examine large claims and claims
outstanding for over three years to initiate appropriate action in order
to expedite settlement. s) Treatment of Orphan Claims: These are third
party claims where no policy details are available. Sometimes, Claims
Tribunals serve notice only on the Insurance Company and no claim
petition is received, then such cases are registered as Orphan Claims
and a separate list is kept of such claims.</p>
