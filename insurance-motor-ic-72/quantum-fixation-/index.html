<ol>
<li>Assessment of Compensation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The purpose of granting damages in pecuniary termsunder the
Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 is to provide to the dependents of the victim of
motor accident a capital sum, if there had not been an accident by the
careless act of the driver of a motor vehicle. The amount has to be
sufficient to supply the dependents / representatives with material
benefits of the same standard and duration, as would have been provided
for them. Credit is given to the value of any ‗material benefit&rsquo; that
would have accrued to them if death or disability had occurred. Specific
guidelines have been given for the recovery of pecuniary ‗loss to
estate&rsquo; of the deceased for such damages by the Amendment 54 of 1994 in
Motor Vehicle Act 1988. Under Section 163(A) ‗Structured Compensation
schedule&rsquo; has been appended on No Fault basis. The courts tend to treat
it as reference for determining the amount of compensation under Section
166 of the 1988 Act, which takes into account tortuous liability.</p>
<h2 id="2types-of-damages">2.Types of Damages</h2>
<p>Diagram 1: Types of damages</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-motor/Quantum_Fixation_101.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>Law contemplates two sorts of damages: i.</p>
<p>The one is the pecuniary „loss to the estate&rsquo; of the deceased resulting
from the accident. The damages for the loss caused to the estate are
claimed on behalf of the estate and when recovered, form part of the
assets of the estate.</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. The other loss is the pecuniary ‗loss sustained by the members‟ of the
family through the death of the victim. The action for this is brought
by the legal representatives not for the estate, but as trustees for the
relatives beneficially entitled.</p>
<p>In order to determine an amount of compensation payable to motor
accident victim, the damages have to be assessed separately as: i.</p>
<p>Pecuniary damages: The pecuniary damages are those which the victim has
actually incurred and which are capable of being quantified in terms of
money. In [(1995) ACJ 366] Supreme Court had observed that ―Whenever
compensation is to be awarded for pain and suffering and loss of amenity
of life, the special circumstances of the claimant are taken into
account including his age, the unusual deprivation he has suffered, the
effect thereon on his life.</p>
<p>ii. Non-pecuniary damages: The amount for non-pecuniary loss is not
easy to determine but the award must reflect that different
circumstances have been taken into consideration.</p>
<h2 id="permissible-heads-for-assessment">Permissible Heads for Assessment</h2>
<h2 id="a-in-case-of-death">a) In case of death</h2>
<p>i. Loss of dependency: It is generally
notional dependency of legal representatives or the claimants and does
not envisage actual proof of dependency. i . Loss of expectancy a
conventional sum is allowed i i. Loss of consortium a conventional sum
is allowed iv. Funeral expenses a conventional sum is allowed v. Medical
expenses if deceased was given any treatment prior to fatality b) In
case of simple injury In case of simple injuries the compensation
awarded is global compensation and no separate amount is awarded for
medical expenses. However, if any X-ray or scanning is done, actual
expenses incurred have to be reimbursed in addition to global
compensation. Any incidental simple injuries sustained in an accident
alongwith grievous injuries, no separate compensation need be granted in
respect of simple injuries.</p>
<h2 id="c-in-case-of-grievous-injury">c) In case of grievous injury</h2>
<p>The permissible heads for determination
of compensation in case of grievous injury are as given below:
Compensation for pain and suffering is to be granted by awarding for
injuries or fractures of different bones e.g.  Cranial bones or skull,
Cerebral concussion i.e., injury to the brain resulting in
unconsciousness,  Cerebral contusion i.e., a direct blow to any part of
the brain or cerebral edema i.e., swelling resulting in collection of
blood within the brain membrane or capillary hemorrhage (bruises)
Cerebral laceration leading to multiple neurological deficiencies  Eye
having damage to optic nerve resulting in loss of vision  Facial bones
consisting of lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek bone, orbit bone i.e., socket
for resting eye ball  Nasal bones  Loss of tooth  Spinal column
otherwise called back bone  Clavicle (collar) bone  Scapular (shoulder
girdle) bone  Rib fractures (12 in number)  Humerus (arm bone)  Elbow
joint  Scaphoid bone (wrist joint and one out of 8 carpal bones)  Meta
carpal bones 5 in number  Pelvic bone consisting of two hip bones
situated at lower abdomen  Acetabulam bone, Pubic bone fracture may
result in rupture of urethra requiring catheters permanently.
Spleenectomy and removal of spleen does not affect longevity of health
of the suffering person  Liver, Kidney, Femur (thigh) Bone  Fracture
of Patella (Knee cap bone)  Ligaments (Lateral, Medial, Cruciate
anterior/ posterior)  Meniscus (medial &amp; lateral cartilages in knee
joint)  Haemarthrosis (collection of blood into joint)  Biceps or calf
Muscles (tearing and loss)  Tibia &amp; Fibula bones in the leg between
knee joint and ankle joint  Ankle joint  Foot  Fracture of Fingers
and Toes  Avulsion injury resulting in fracture of bones with tendons
Nerve Palsy: It is damage to nerves resulting in paralysis of the
muscles (Neuropraxia (reversible type of disability), Axontmesis (severe
injury), Neurotmesis (whole nerve cut) 464</p>
<p>While assessing compensation for pain and suffering for a person, who
has sustained more than one fracture and grievous injury in different
parts of the body, the fracture of grievous injury which calls for
maximum amount of compensation for pain and agony should be reckoned
first and additional fracture of grievous injury for different parts of
the body and additional amount for each such distinct injuries is to be
added and aggregate of the said amounts is awarded for pain and
suffering for all injuries taking into consideration Medical expenses
including nursing, attendants and nourishment</p>
<h2 id="d-loss-of-income-during-the-period-of-treatment">d) Loss of income during the period of treatment</h2>
<p>i.Actual or notional wages or salary for the period of treatment is to be
granted. In case the victim had availing sick leave; proportionate
salary for the leave period should be allowed to compensate for loss of
leave.</p>
<p>ii. Loss of future earning capacity on account of permanent
disabilities is computed when there is ―functional disability‖. If the
disability does not affect earning capacity or career, no amount need be
awarded. The multiplier principle as applicable in case of death is to
be adopted to ascertain loss of future earnings. iii. Future medical
expenses: These are expenses incurred for corrective surgeries or
replacement of medical aids and provision of equipment essential for
having permanent handicaps. iv. Future unhappiness and loss of
amenities: It depends upon nature of lasting disability or
disfigurement. It could be amputation of limb, loss of vision of one
eye, total impairment of hearing capacity of one year, any ugly visible
scar, mal-union of fractures or limping. v. Loss of marital prospects:
It depends upon the gravity of the threat to marital prospects. vi. Loss
of academic year in education: This can be compensated upon proof of the
actual expenses incurred for the academic year vii. Shortening of life
span as a consequence of injury: It may attract compensation based on
medical opinion regarding shortening of life span on account of injury.
In such cases the future earning capacity and future medical expenses
shall be computed based on shortened life span. The total compensation
payable will be the aggregate of the compensation awarded towards each
permissible head.</p>
<h2 id="3-damage-to-third-party-property">3. Damage to Third Party Property</h2>
<p>The term property includes livestock,
vehicle, building etc.</p>
<p>i.In case of damages to vehicles minimum ‗idling charges&rsquo; depending upon
reasonable time for repairs would be payable.</p>
<p>i.. In case of package policies, the insurer reimburse the damage to
property upon production of proof of actual damage assessed on the basis
of bills of repairs etc.</p>
<p>i.. In case of total loss, depreciation is while reimbursing the full
value of the property.</p>
<p>taken</p>
<p>into</p>
<p>account</p>
<p>iv. A claim for loss of buffalo would come within the ambit of claim
for damage to property. In another claim it was held that an elephant
would not come within the ambit of property. [2008 ACJ 14 (Raj)]. v.
The claim for damage to onion carried in the vehicle was not required to
be covered under the contract of insurance. [(Jahar Deb vs. National
Insurance Co. Ltd.) 2007 ACJ 2169 (Gau)]. vi. The claim for damage to
property based on ‗letter of subrogation&rsquo; would be outside the purview
of a Claims Tribunal and will lie only before a Civil Court. vi. . The
Own Damage claim for vehicles cannot be lodged before MACT. [2008 (1)
TN MAC 112]. Also in [2007 (4) ACC 263 (Gau) (DB)]. vii. . A civil
suit for damage to a vehicle washed away in floods was opposed as not
tenable since Claims Tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction. It was held
that Section 175 was not a bar for such suit, as it was a contractual
claim by the owner against his insurer. [(Jahar Deb vs. National
Insurance Co. Ltd.) 2007 ACJ 2169 (Gau)]. ix. It was held that Own
Damage claim of the owner of the vehicle against his own insurer was not
tenable before the Claims Tribunal. The proper forum would be a civil
court or a consumer forum. [(State Express Transport Corporation vs. G.
Kathamuthu ) 2007 (2) TN MAC 432 (Mad)]. The claim by an owner of a
motor vehicle for damages to his vehicle against his own insurer was
held not maintainable before the Claims Tribunal since only a Third
Party could file such a claim. [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Pooranlal) 2007 ACJ 1804 (Chati)] x. In a case where the Own Damage
claim was settled by the insurer, the claim by the owner of vehicle for
the disallowed portion against the negligent vehicle was remitted for
fresh consideration. 466</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-1">Test Yourself 1</h2>
<p>Under the permissible heads for assessment, in case of
death of a person, which of the below will be payable? I. Loss of
dependency II. Loss of expectancy III. Funeral expenses IV. All of the
above</p>
<h2 id="b-option-to-choose-jurisdiction">B. Option to choose Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>In a claim for damage to a motor
vehicle in an accident, it was held that the sum received by the
claimant from his insurer in respect of own damage claim couldn&rsquo;t be
deducted from the claim against the tort-feasor. The tort-feasor cannot
get the benefit of any such deduction. [(GSRTC vs. Hargovinddas R.
Modi) 2007 ACJ 1198 (Guj)]. It was further held in [GSRTC vs.
Hargovinddas R. Modi)) 2007 ACJ 1198 (Guj)]. that damage arising from
non-use of the vehicle being revenue loss could also be laid before the
Tribunal. In another case the claim was for damage to goods carried in
the vehicle before the Claims Tribunal. It was held that such a claim
would not lie before the Tribunal and appropriate remedy was before a
civil court. [(Oriental Fire &amp; General Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. S.
Rasheed Ahammad) 2007 ACJ 1433 (Kant)].</p>

<li>Various Methods</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>It is amply
clear that no amount of compensation can restore the physical frame of
the victim in the original shape. The courts have been applying the
principle of ‗Just Compensation‟ and ‗multiplier method‟ ‗statutory
formula of Structured Compensation‟ in different circumstances depending
upon the provisions of law applicable for the victims and being invoked
by the claimants.</p>

<p>The Multiplier method is also known as Lord Wright‟s formula was enunciated
in Davies vs. Powell, a famous English case which comprised of
multiplying annual dependency amount of that deceased would have spent
on the dependents by the commonly accepted multiplier known as ‗year
purchase factor‟. (A-E) * (Y) = Total compensation for loss dependency
as well as loss to the estate</p>
<h2 id="option-to-choose-jurisdiction">OPTION TO CHOOSE JURISDICTION</h2>
<p>where: A = Amount of net wages earned by the deceased E = Expenditure
incurred by the deceased on his own self Y = Number of years (A-E)
covers the amount of loss of dependency as well as amount of accretion
to his estate (A-E) must be split up to know the separate figures of
dependency and accretion to the estate. In Davies vs. Powell; Lord
Wright stated that ―It is hard matter of pounds, shilling and pence
subject to the element of reasonable future probabilities. The starting
point is the amount of wages the deceased was earning, the ascertainment
of which to some extent may depend upon the regularity of his
employment. Then there is an estimate of how much was required or
expended for his personal and living expenses. The balance will give a
datum or basic figure which will generally be turned into a lump sum
[that] however, has to be taxed down by having due regard to
uncertainties for instance, the widow might have remarried and thus
ceased to be dependent, and other like matters of speculation and
doubt‖. This method takes into account not only discount on arriving at
lump sum amount of benefit spread over number of years, but also
discount for other contingencies and imponderables.</p>
<h2 id="b-selection-of-multiplier">b) Selection of Multiplier</h2>
<p>It is chosen according to the age of the claimant only in
fatal cases. The age of the accident victim is to be considered in line
with the decision of the Apex Court reported in [(UPSRTC V. Trilok
Chandra &amp; Others.) (1996) ACJ 831] The multiplier thereafter, to be
applied would be dependent on the age of the deceased or dependent,
whichever is higher. Maximum multiplier is fixed at 18 as against 16 as
prescribed in Susamma Thomas case. However, selection of multiplier
cannot be solely dependent on the age of the deceased in all cases. Age
of the parents is also relevant in case of death of a bachelor. If the
deceased died without a family and the parents were claimants the
appropriate multiplier should be based on the age of the parents and not
that of the deceased. [(Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay vs.
Shri Laxman Iyer and another) AIR 2003 SC 4182] The multiplier
prescribed by the Supreme Court is one or two points more than that laid
down in Schedule 2 for compensation under Section 163A of the MV
Act1988.</p>
<p>Age of the deceased Up to 15 years 16 to 20Years 21 to 25 years 26 to 30
years 31 to 35 years 36 to 40 years 41 to 45 years 46 to 50 years 51 to
55 years 56 to 60 years 61 to 65 years Above 65 years</p>

<h2 id="c-highest-and-lowest-multiplier">c) Highest and lowest multiplier</h2>
<p>The award can be more than the claim
and even without any crossobjections. Multiplier method cannot be
applied mechanically. The multiplier in case of a deceased Panchayat
President, Agriculturist, aged 61 years, was reduced to 5 and the award
accordingly reduced. Earnings of Rs. 500/- p.m. IT return after accident
was rejected. The income was fixed at Rs. 7,000/- p.m. in all and
adopting a multiplier of 18 an award for Rs. 10,08,072/- was confirmed.
Maximum multiplier fixed at 18 as against 16 prescribed in Susamma
Thomas case.</p>
<h2 id="d-principles-for-computing-compensation">d) Principles for computing compensation</h2>
<p>In [(Kerala SRTC
vs. Susuma Thomos) 1994 ACJ 1 (SC)] the Apex Court considered method of
arriving at proper multiplier on a scientific basis for arriving at a
proper multiplicand and multiple in fatal accidents in the light of
decided cases in our country, as well as in England and laid down
principles for computing compensation in motor vehicle accident cases.
On the question of selection of multiplicand Lord Diplock observed, ―The
starting point in any estimate of the amount of the dependency is the
annual value of the material benefits provided for the dependants out of
the earnings of the deceased on the date of his death. But there are
many factors, which might have led to variations up or down in the
future. His earnings might have increased and with them the amount
provided by him for his dependants. They might have diminished with a
recession in trade or children grew up and became independent; the
proportion of his earnings spent on his dependants would have been
likely to fall‖.</p>
<h2 id="e-effect-of-future-prospects-on-multiplicand">e) Effect of future prospects on Multiplicand</h2>
<p>The multiplicand to be
applied to calculate future prospects would depend on the age of the
deceased. Thus an age below 40 would result in 50% loading of present
income, age 40 to 50 a 30% loading and age over 50 no loading. Age Group
Below 40 40 to 50 Over 50</p>
<p>Future Income Income + 50% of income Income + 30% of income Income</p>
<h2 id="f-multiplier-for-foreigners--nri">f) Multiplier for Foreigners / NRI</h2>
<p>The deceased was aged 36 years with
a Masters in Business Administration (MBA). She was earning US$ 2500 in
USA. The claimants were husband, daughter and son. The Tribunal
construed the income / dependency at US$ 2000 and arrived at
compensation of Rs. 1,14,75,000/- in all. On appeal, the High Court took
the earnings at US$ 2000, reduced 1/3rd for personal expenses and
adopting a multiplier of 13, assessed the compensation payable at Rs.
66,49,000/- in all. [(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Yogeshbhai
Ramanbhai Shah) 2007]. For victims employed abroad, foreign exchange
rate was held to be effective as on date of judgment.</p>
<h2 id="g-factors-for-variations-in-dependency">g) Factors for variations in dependency</h2>
<p>there are two factors to be borne in mind for
giving effect in award of damages to possible variations in the
dependency. First is that the more remote is the anticipated change in
the future, the lesser confidence there can be, in the chance of its
occurring and smaller the allowance to be made for it in the assessment.
Second is that as a matter of the arithmetic of the calculation of
present value, the later the change takes place the lesser will be its
effect upon the total award of damages. i. In case of the deceased being
bachelor or spinster, 50% is to be deducted instead of 1/3rd of income
towards personal needs and maintenance of the deceased and balance is
taken for dependency. ii. In case of the deceased leaving behind only
Brothers and Sisters or only spouse, 50% is to be deducted towards
personal needs and maintenance of the deceased and balance is taken for
dependency.</p>
<p>iii. In case of the deceased being a bachelor leaving behind parents
with at least a brother or sister, 1/3rd is to be allowed towards
personal needs and maintenance. iv. For applying multiplier in case the
deceased leaves behind his parents, and brother and sister, the youngest
parent is considered and not the brother or sister,. v. In case the
deceased is an agriculturist and owns agriculture land, the computation
of income shall be on the basis of normal wages paid towards effective
supervisory charges for supervising the agricultural operations
irrespective of the yield and income from the agriculture produce. [AIR
1982 Gujarat 260]</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Impact of Interest Rate on Multiplier</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>As the
interest rate is on decline, the multiplier has consequentially to be
raised. The use of the correct multiplier for determination of
compensation to be awarded to the legal representatives of a victim of a
road accident is illustrated in [(U.P. State Road Transport Corporation
and others vs. Trilok Chandra &amp; Others) date of judgment: 07/05/1996)].
In fact Trilok Chandra case (supra) is to serve as a guide, but cannot
be said to be invariable ready reckoner. The highest multiplier has to
be for the age group of 21 years to 25 years when an ordinary Indian
citizen starts independent earnings and the lowest at 60 to 70 years,
which is the normal retirement age. If the chances of variation in the
dependency are to be reflected in the multiplicand of the years purchase
is the multiplier, variations in the dependency are not expected to take
place until after ten years. It should have a relatively small effect in
increasing or diminishing the dependency used for the purpose of
assessing the damages. Case of Nance: In the method adopted by Viscount
Simon in the case of Nance also, first the annual dependency is worked
out and then multiplied is determined by the estimated useful life of
the deceased. This is generally determined on the basis of longevity.
But then, proper discounting on various factors have a bearing on the
uncertainties of life, such as, premature death of the deceased or the
dependent, remarriage, accelerated payment and in increased earning by
wise and prudent investments etc.</p>
<h2 id="3-discounting-on-various-imponderables---hybrid-method">3. Discounting on Various Imponderables - Hybrid Method</h2>
<p>It was
generally felt that discounting on various imponderables made assessment
of compensation rather complicated and cumbersome and very often as a
rough and ready measure, one-third to one-half of the dependency was
reduced, depending on the life span considered. That is the reason why
Courts in India as well as England preferred the Davies formula, it
being simple and more realistic. However, as pointed out in Susamma
Thomas case, usually English courts rarely exceed 16 as the multiplier.
Courts in India too followed the same pattern till recently when
Tribunal / Courts began to use a hybrid method of using Nance method
without making deductions for Imponderables. The situation has now
undergone a change with the enactment of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988,
as amended by amendment Act, 54 of 1994. The most important change
introduced by the amendment in so far as it relates to determination of
compensation is the insertion of Section 163A and 163B in Chapter XI
entitled Insurance of Motor Vehicles against Third Party Risks. Section
163A begins with a ‗non-obstante clause&rsquo; and provides for payment of
compensation, as indicated in the Second Schedule, to the legal
representatives of the deceased or injured, as the case may be. Now if
we turn to the Second Schedule, we find a table fixing the mode of
calculating compensation for third party accident injury claims arising
out of fatal accidents. i.</p>
<p>The first column gives the age group of the victims of accident,</p>
<p>i . The second column indicates the multiplier and ii. . The subsequent
horizontal figures indicate the quantum of compensation in thousands
payable to the heirs of the deceased victim According to this table the
multiplier varies from 5 to 18 depending on the age group to which the
victim belonged.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>No Fault Liability</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Negligence is a fundamental
requirement to sustain a claim before Claims Tribunal. Supreme Court
adverted to the absence of ‗No Fault Regime&rsquo; in [(State of Haryana Vs.
Darshana Devi) 1979 ACJ 205: AIR 1979 SC 855]; [(Concord of India
Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Nirmala Devi) 1980 ACJ 55] and thereby
Parliament was compelled to step in and introduce Act 47 of 1982 as on
1/10/ 82. By virtue of Section 92-A of MV Act, 1939 provision for an
interim award was introduced. Sub-section (4) was clear in indicating
that a claim under no fault liability shall not be defeated or reduced
for any fault on the part of the victim. Parliament had differed from
the known path based on tortuous liability and provided for relief even
where the victim was at fault. 472</p>
<p>This position of law was corrected by the Supreme Court in
[(Nandakumars Case 1996 ACJ 555)] wherein it was held that a victim
can sustain a claim under ‗No fault Liability&rsquo; even where he himself was
at fault. The claim for minimum compensation cannot be defeated or
reduced for fault or contribution to fault by the victim himself.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Structured Compensation Method</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Section 163A was enacted for grant of
immediate relief to a section of the people whose annual income is not
more than Rs. 40,000/- having regard to the fact that in terms of
Section 163A of the Act read with the Second Schedule appended thereto,
compensation is to be paid on a ‗structured formula&rsquo; not only having
regard to the age of the victim and his income, but also the other
relevant factors. An award made shall be in full and final settlement of
the claim, as would appear from the different columns contained in the
Second Schedule appended to the Act. The compensation awarded is not
interim in nature. The note appended to deal with fatal accident makes
the position furthermore clear, stating that from the total amount of
compensation one-third part is to be reduced in consideration of the
expenses which the victim would have incurred towards maintaining
himself, had he been alive. This together with the other heads of
compensation leaves no iota of doubt that the Parliament intended to lay
a comprehensive scheme for the purpose of grant of adequate compensation
to a section of victims who would require the amount of compensation
without contesting a protracted litigation for proving that the accident
occurred owing to negligence on the part of the driver of the motor
vehicle or any other fault arising out of use of a motor vehicle. The
scheme for payment of compensation under the 1988 Act can be divided as
under: i.</p>
<p>Section 140 for no-fault liability in case of death or disablement;</p>
<p>ii. Section 161: In case of hit-and-run motor accidents, where the
identity of the vehicle cannot be ascertained, compensation amount is
Rs. 25,000/- in case of death and Rs. 12,500/- in case of grievous hurt;
iii. Section 163A: Special provisions as to payment of compensation on
structured formula basis without establishing or proving any wrongful
act or neglect or default of any person; iv. Section 168 for
determination of compensation payable in pursuance of any right on the
principle of fault liability.</p>
<p>The Claims Tribunal is required to determine the application for payment
of compensation either under Section 140 or Section 163A on the
principle of nofault liability and also on the basis of right to receive
compensation on the principle of fault liability on the basis of Law of
Torts, as modified by the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 read with Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988.</p>
<h2 id="a-whether-award-is-final-under-section-163-a">a) Whether Award is Final under Section 163-A?</h2>
<p>Section 163-A Second Schedule, has been enacted dispensing with the need
for claimants to prove fault. Section 163-A appeared to be extension of
No Fault Liability regime. The question still remained whether a person
who was at fault himself can sustain a claim under Section 163-A. It is
true that the claimants need not prove negligence. The Supreme Court
concluded that an award under Section 163-A was final and not interim.
But it cannot be understood as suggesting that where the claimant was
himself at fault, he can sustain the claim under 163-A. As for the
Supreme Court‗s stray observations in [(Deepal Girishbai Sonis case)
2004 ACJ 934] to the effect that Section 163-A of the Act covers cases
where even negligence is on the part of the victim. It is by way of an
exception to Section 166 and the concept of social justice has been duly
taken care of, has queered the pitch.</p>
<h2 id="b-legislative-intent-for-structured-compensation">b) Legislative intent for Structured Compensation</h2>
<p>From the provisions quoted above, it appears
that no specific mention is made whether remedy provided under Section
163A is in addition or an alternative to the determination of
compensation on the principle of fault liability. Section 163A was not
present in the original Act of 1988 and was inserted by an Amendment 54
of 1994. Hence for arriving at the proper conclusion, it would be
necessary to cull out legislative intent by referring to the legislative
history as well as Objects and Reasons for inserting the said provision.</p>
<h2 id="c-reasons-of-structured-compensation">c) Reasons of Structured Compensation</h2>
<p>Where a pedestrian without
negligence on his part is injured or killed by a motorist, whether
negligently or not, he or his legal representative as the case may be,
will be entitled to recover damages if the principle of social justice
should have any meaning at all. In order to meet to some extent the
responsibility of the society to the death and injury caused in road
accident, there has been continuous agitation throughout the world to
make the liability for damages arising out of motor vehicles accidents
as a liability without fault. In order to meet the above social demand
on the recommendation of the Indian Law Commission Chapter VIIA was
introduced in the 1939 Act vide Sections 92-A to 92-E of the Act.</p>
<h2 id="d-relief-to-the-victims">d) Relief to the victims</h2>
<p>The reason for enacting Section 163A is to
give earliest relief to the victims of the motor vehicle accidents. It
is also apparent that compensation payable under Section 163A is almost
based on relevant criteria for determining the compensation such as
annual income, age of the victim and multiplier to be applied. In
addition to the figure which is arrived at on the basis of said
criteria, schedule also provides that amount of compensation shall not
be less than Rs. 50,000/-. It provides for fixed amount of general
damage in case of death such as: i. Rs. 2,000/- for funeral expenses i .
Rs. 5,000/- for loss of consortium if beneficiary is the spouse i i. Rs.
2,400/- for loss of estate iv. For medical expenses supported by the
bills, voucher not exceeding Rs. 15,000/-. Similarly, for disability in
non-fatal accident Para 5 of the Schedule provides for determination of
compensation on the basis of permanent disability. Para 6 provides for
notional income for those who had no income prior to accident at Rs.
15,000/- per annum. There is also provision for reduction of 1/3rd
amount of compensation on the assumption that the victim would have
incurred the said amount towards maintaining himself had he been alive.
Use of Specific Language in Sections 140, 141, 161 and 163A: Sections
140 to 143 provide for liability of the owner of the vehicle in case of
death or permanent disablement of any person resulting from an accident
arising out of use of a motor vehicle to pay compensation without any
pleading or establishing that death or permanent disablement was due to
any wrongful act, neglect or default of the owner or owners of the
vehicle or vehicles. By way of earliest relief, the victim is entitled
to get the amount of compensation of Rs. 50,000/- in case of death and
Rs. 25,000/- in case of permanent disablement. It is further provided
that such claim shall not be defeated by reason of any wrongful Act,
neglect or default of the person in respect of whose death or permanent
disablement has occurred. This is further confirmed by Section 141 which
provides that the right to claim compensation under Section 140 is in
addition to any other right to claim compensation on the principle of
fault liability and specifically excludes the right to claim
compensation under the scheme referred to in Section 163A.</p>
<h2 id="6-hit-and-run-motor-accidents">6. Hit-And-Run Motor Accidents</h2>
<p>Similarly, Section 161 provides for
payment of compensation in case of hit-andrun motor accidents. Under
Section 161(3), in respect of the death of any person resulting from a
hit-and-run motor accident, a fixed sum of Rs. 25,000/is to be paid as
compensation and in grievous hurt, the amount fixed is Rs.12,500/-.</p>
<h2 id="a-refund-of-compensation-under-section-161">a) Refund of compensation under Section 161</h2>
<p>Section 162, the legislature
has provided for refund of compensation paid under Section 161 by
providing that the payment of compensation under Section 161 shall be
subject to the condition that if any compensation is awarded under any
other provision of this Act or any other law or otherwise, so much
amount as is equal to the compensation paid under Section 161 is
required to be adjusted or refunded to the insurer. As such the claimant
is not entitled to have additional compensation but at the same time he
can proceed by filing application under Section 166 or under the
Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act 1923 (i.e. other law) and if he gets
compensation under either of the said provisions, the amount paid under
Section 161 is to be refunded or adjusted. The Legislature has
specifically provided scheme of adjustment of compensation under Section
140 read with Section 141 and Section 162 if the claimants get
compensation under the Act, while there is no such provision under
Section 163A.</p>
<h2 id="b-solatium-fund-scheme-section-163-2">b) Solatium Fund Scheme Section 163 (2)</h2>
<p>The scheme made
may provide that i. A contravention of any provision thereof shall be
punishable with imprisonment for such term as may be specified but in no
case exceeding three months, or with fine which may extend to such
amount as may be specified but in no case exceeding five hundred rupees
or with both;
i.. The powers, functions or duties conferred or imposed on any Officer or
Authority by such scheme may be delegated with the prior approval in
writing of the Central Government, by such Officer or Authority to any
other Officer or Authority;</p>
<p>i.. Any provision of such scheme may operate with retrospective effect
from a date not earlier than the date of establishment of the Solatium
Fund under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, (4 of 1939) as it stood
immediately before the commencement of this Act.</p>
<h2 id="7-comparison-with-section-166">7. Comparison with Section 166</h2>
<p>Section 166 of the Act evidently stands
on a different footing. The extent of compensation payable may vary from
case to case. Various other factors including i. Contributory
negligence, i . Earning capacity, ii. . Extent of negligence on the part
of one vehicle or the other, are relevant factors for computation of
damages Loss of property can also be a subject matter of the claim
petition. The compensation payable under Section 163A of the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 as per the structured formula is in addition or an
alternative to the determination of the compensation on the principle of
fault liability, after following the procedure prescribed under the Act?</p>
<h2 id="a-just-compensation">a) Just Compensation</h2>
<p>Section 168 of 1988 Act is required to make an
award determining the amount of compensation which is to be in the real
sense damages, which in turn appears to it to be just and reasonable. It
has to be borne in mind that compensation for loss of limbs or life can
hardly be weighed in golden scales. But at the same time it has to be
borne in mind that the compensation is not expected to be a windfall for
the victim. Statutory provisions clearly indicate that the compensation
must be just and it can neither be a bonanza nor a source of profit; but
the same should not be a pittance as well. The Courts and Tribunals have
a duty to weigh various factors and quantify the amount of compensation,
which should be just. What would be just compensation is a vexed
question. There can be no golden rule applicable to all cases for
measuring the value of human life or a limb. Measure of damages cannot
be arrived at by precise mathematical calculations. It would depend upon
the particular facts and circumstances, and attending peculiar or
special features, if any. Every method or mode adopted for assessing
compensation has to be considered in the background of just compensation
which is the pivotal consideration. Though by use of the expression
which appears to it to be just, a wide discretion is vested in the
Tribunal. The determination has to be rational, to be done by a
judicious approach and not the outcome of whims, wild guesses and
arbitrariness. The expression ‗just&rsquo; denotes equity, fairness and
reasonableness and nonarbitrariness. If it is not so it cannot be just.</p>
<h2 id="b-dictionary-meaning-of-compensation">b) Dictionary meaning of compensation</h2>
<p>The word compensation is not
defined in the 1988 Act or in the Rules; it is the giving of an
equivalent or substitute of equivalent value. Compensation is shown as
equivalent in money for a loss sustained; or giving back an equivalent,
in either money which is but the measure of value, or in actual value
otherwise conferred; or recompense in value for some loss, injury or
service especially when it is given by statute. It means when
compensation is paid in terms of money, it must represent on the date of
ordering such payment, the equivalent value. In this context we may look
at Section 168 (1) also. It says that the right of any person to claim
compensation before the Claims Tribunal as indicated in Section 164 or
164A shall not affect the right of any such person to recover
compensation payable under any other law for the time being in force.
But there is an interdict that no person shall be entitled to claim
compensation for more than once in respect of the same accident. This
means that the party has two alternatives: i.</p>
<p>One is to avail himself of his civil remedy to claim compensation based
on common law or any other statutory provision, and</p>
<p>i . The other is to apply before the Claims Tribunal under Section 164
or 164-A of the Act. As the claimant cannot avail himself both the
remedies, he has to choose one between the two. The provisions in
Chapter XII of the 1988 Act are intended to provide a speedier remedy to
the victims of accidents and untoward incidents. If he were to choose
the latter that does not mean that he should be prepared to get a lesser
amount. He is given the assurance by the legislature that the Central
Government is alive to the need for prescribing fair and just
compensation in the Rules from time to time. The provisions are not
intended to give an advantage to the Railway Administration but they are
meant to afford just and reasonable compensation to the victims as a
speedier measure. If a person files a suit the amount of compensation
will depend upon what the court considers just and reasonable on the
date of determination. Hence, when he goes before the Claims Tribunal
claiming compensation, the determination of the amount should be as on
the date of such determination.</p>
<h2 id="c-definition-of-income">c) Definition of Income</h2>
<p>Definition The term income in Advanced Law Lexicon (3rd Ed.) by P.
Ramanatha Aiyars has been defined as the value of any benefit or
perquisite whether convertible into money or not, obtained from a
company either by a director or a person who has substantial interest in
the company, and any sum paid by such company in respect of any
obligation, which but for such payment would have been payable by the
director or other person aforesaid, occurring or arising to a person
within the State from any profession, trade or calling other than
agriculture. Income signifies what comes in. It is as large a word as
can be used to denote a person&rsquo;s receipts. Income is not confined to
receipts from business only and means periodical receipts from ones
work, land, investment, etc.</p>
<p>Definition If the dictionary meaning of the word income is taken to its
logical conclusion, it should include those benefits, either in terms of
money or otherwise, which are taken into consideration for the purpose
of payment of income-tax or profession tax; although some elements
thereof may or may not be taxable or would have been otherwise taxable
but for the exemption conferred thereupon under the statute. The
assessment of damages to compensate the dependants is beset with
difficulties because from the nature of things, it has to take into
account many imponderables e.g. i.</p>
<p>the life expectancy of the deceased and the dependants,</p>
<p>i.. the amount that the deceased would have earned during the remainder of
his life,</p>
<p>i.. the amount that he would have during that period,</p>
<p>contributed to the dependants</p>
<p>iv. the chances that the deceased may not have lived or the dependants
may not live up to the estimated remaining period of their life
expectancy, v. the chances that the deceased might have got better
employment or income or might have lost his employment or income
together</p>
<h2 id="d-net-income">d) Net income</h2>
<p>The manner of arriving at the damages is to ascertain the
net income of the deceased available for the support of himself and his
dependants, and to deduct there from such part of his income as the
deceased was accustomed to spend upon himself, as regards both
self-maintenance and pleasure, and to ascertain what part of his net
income the deceased was accustomed to spend for the benefit of the
dependants. Then that part of the net income should be capitalised by
multiplying it by a figure representing the proper number of years
purchase. Much of the calculation necessarily remains in the realm of
hypothesis and in that region arithmetic is a good servant but a bad
master, since there are so often many imponderables. In every case it is
the overall picture that matters and the court must try to assess as
best as it can to compensate the loss suffered. In [(New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Charlie &amp; Anr) (2005) 10 SCC 720)], the word net
income has been used but the same itself would ordinarily mean gross
income minus the statutory deductions. The said decision has been
followed in [(New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Kalpana (Smt.) &amp; Ors.)
(2007) 3 SCC 538].</p>
<h2 id="e-private-sector-approach-to-contributory-provident-fund">e) Private Sector Approach to Contributory Provident Fund</h2>
<p>The private sector companies in place of introducing a Pension
Scheme take recourse to payment of contributory provident fund, gratuity
and other perks to attract efficient and hard-working people. The
employer may make different offers to an officer; it may be either for
the benefit of the employee himself or for the benefit of the entire
family. If some facilities are being provided whereby the entire family
stands to benefit, the same must be held to be relevant for the purpose
of computation of total income on the basis whereof, the amount of
compensation payable for the death of the kith and kin of the applicants
is required to be determined. The elements of wages paid to the deceased
include: i. Basic Pay, i . Conveyance Allowance, i i. Rent Co Lease, iv.
Bonus (35% of Basic)</p>
<p>v. Other entitlements are Contribution to PF 10% of Basic, LTA
reimbursement, Medical reimbursement, Superannuation 15% of Basic,
Gratuity Contribution @ 5.34% of Basic, Medical policy - self &amp; Family,
Education scholarship, payable to his two children directly. There are
three basic features in the aforementioned statement: i.</p>
<p>Reimbursement of rent to be equivalent to HRA</p>
<p>i . Bonus is payable as a part of salary; and ii. . Contribution to the
Provident Fund Apart from these superannuation benefits, contributions
towards gratuity, medical insurance policy for self and family and
education scholarship also benefit the members of the family. Medical
reimbursement, which provides for a slab and which keeping in view the
terminology used, would mean reimbursement for medical expenses on
production of medical bills, would not come within the purview of the
aforementioned category.</p>
<h2 id="f-contributions-by-salaried-person-are-deferred-payment">f) Contributions by salaried person are deferred payment</h2>
<p>It was held that Income Tax and Professional Tax which
is deducted from the salaried person goes to the coffers of the
government under specific head and there is no return. Whereas, the
General Provident Fund, Special Provident Fund, LIC, other contributions
are amounts paid in specific heads and the contribution is always
repayable to an employee at the time of voluntary retirement, death or
for any other reason, such contribution made by the salaried person are
deferred payment and are savings. In view of the settled proposition of
law, the Claims Tribunal can make only statutory deductions such as
Income Tax and Professional Tax and any other contribution which is not
repayable by the employer from the salary of the deceased person, while
determining the monthly income for computing the dependency
compensation. Any contribution made by the employee during his life
time, forms part of the salary and it should be included in the monthly
income, while computing the dependency compensation. The claimants are
entitled to be compensated for the loss suffered by them, which amount
they would have been receiving at the time when the deceased was alive.
There can be no doubt that the dependents would only be receiving the
net amount less l/3rd for his personal expenses. The High Court was in
[Asha &amp; Ors. vs. United Indian Insurance Co. Ltd. &amp; Anors. [2004 ACC
533], placed reliance on these points while arguing the case where
several perks were included in salary. It was submitted that the High
Court was wrong in deducting the allowances and amounts paid towards
LIC, Society charges and HBA etc. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>What would be just compensation must be determined having regard to the
facts and circumstances of each case. The basis for considering the
entire pay packet is what the dependents have lost due to death of the
deceased. It is in the nature of compensation for future loss towards
the family income. The amounts which were required to be paid to the
deceased by his employer by way of perks, should be included for
computation of his monthly income, as that would have been added to his
monthly income by way of contribution to the family as contra
distinguished to the ones which were for his benefit subject to
deduction of the statutory amount of tax payable thereupon must be
deducted. [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd vs. Syed Ibrahim &amp; Ors Appeal)

<hr>
<h2 id="a-determination-of-damages-for-a-child-or-non-earning-person">a) Determination of Damages for a Child or Non-earning Person</h2>
<p>The determination of damages for loss of human life is an extremely
difficult task and it becomes all the more baffling when the deceased is
a child and / or a non-earning person. The future of a child is
uncertain. Where the deceased was a child, he was earning nothing but
had a prospect to earn. The question of assessment of compensation,
therefore, becomes stiffer. The figure of compensation involves a good
deal of guesswork. In cases, where parents are claimants, relevant
factor would be age of parents.</p>
<h2 id="b-compensation-for-death-of-an-infant">b) Compensation for death of an Infant</h2>
<p>The House of Lords in [(Taff
Vale Rly vs. Jenkins) (1913) AC 1] laid down the principle for
compensation in case of the death of an infant. There may have been no
actual pecuniary benefit derived by the parents during the child&rsquo;s
lifetime, but this will not necessarily bar the parents claim, and
prospective loss will find a valid claim provided the parents establish
that they had a ‗reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit‟ if the
child had survived. Lord Atkinson said thus...&ldquo;all that is necessary is
that a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit should be entertained
by the person who sues. It is quite true that the existence of this
expectation is an inference of fact, there must be a basis of fact from
which the inference can reasonably be drawn; but I wish to express my
emphatic dissent from the proposition that it is necessary that two of
the facts without which the inference cannot be drawn are, i.</p>
<p>First that the deceased earned money in the past, and,</p>
<p>i . Second, that he or she contributed to the support of the plaintiff.
These are, no doubt, pregnant pieces of evidence, but they are only
pieces of evidence; and the necessary inference can I think, be drawn
from circumstances other than and different from them‖.</p>
<h2 id="c-distinction-between-various-age-groups">c) Distinction between Various Age Groups</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court [in (Lata Wadhwa and Ors.
vs. State of Bihar and Ors) 2001 (8) SCC 197] while computing
compensation made distinction between deceased children falling within
the age group of 5 to 10 years and age group of 10 to 15 years. In cases
of young children of tender age, in view of uncertainties abound,
neither their income at the time of death nor the prospects of the
future increase in their income nor chances of advancement of their
career are capable of proper determination on estimated basis. The
reason is that at such an early age, the uncertainties in regard to
their academic pursuits, achievements in career and thereafter
advancement in life are so many that nothing can be assumed with
reasonable certainty. Therefore, neither the income of the deceased
child is capable of assessment on estimated basis nor the financial loss
suffered by the parents is capable of mathematical computation. However,
at this juncture it would be relevant to take note of paragraphs 11 and
19 of [(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Kusum Rai and Others) - 2006(4)
SCC 250].</p>
<h2 id="d-multiplier-for-housewife">d) Multiplier for Housewife</h2>
<p>For the death of a 27 year old housewife
leaving behind her husband and 2 minor children, the court adopted a
multiplier of 15 and dependency of Rs. 20,000/-p.a. and reduced the
award of Rs. 3,65,000/- to Rs. 3,30,000/-. [(National Insurance Co.
Ltd. vs. Mahadevan) 2007 (5) MLJ 129 (Mad)]. The claimants were husband
and children of a housewife aged 35 years also engaged in stitching,
agriculture and tending to cattle. The compensation of Rs. 50,000/- was
raised to Rs. 2,18,500/-. For mother aged 40 years, as multiplier of 13
was adopted instead of 17. [2008 (2) TLNJ 564 (Civil)].</p>
<h2 id="e-compensation-slab-for-disability-of-children">e) Compensation Slab for Disability of Children</h2>
<p>For fixing adequate
compensation for children injured in road accidents, the Supreme Court
in Master Mallikarjun vs National Insurance Co. Ltd {[Civil Appeal No.
7139 of 2013 Arising out of S.L.P.(Civil) No. 1676 of 2012]} has
devised a compensation slab between Rs. 3 lakh to Rs. 6 lakh for their
disability ranging from 10% to 90%. &quot;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. that the appropriate
compensation on all other heads in addition to the actual expenditure
for treatment, attendant etc. should be, if the disability is i. Above
10% and up to 30% to the whole body, Rs. 3 lakh; i . Up to 60%, Rs. 4
lakh; ii. . Up to 90%, Rs. 5 lakh and iv. Above 90%, it should be Rs 6
lakh.&quot; After laying down the broad guidelines for computing
compensation, the bench said, &quot;For permanent disability up to 10%, it
should be Rs. 1 lakh, unless there are exceptional circumstances to take
different yardstick.&quot; The difficulty in assessing compensation for
children injured in accidents was mainly because they had no income, as
in the case of adults, to base the quantification on assumed loss of
income owing to disability. Authoring the judgment for the bench,
Justice Kurian said, &quot;For a child, the best part of his life is yet to
come. While considering the claim by a victim child, it would be unfair
and improper to follow the structured formula as per the Second Schedule
to the Motor Vehicles Act for reasons more than one. The main stress in
the formula is on pecuniary damages. For children, there is no income.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;The only indication in the Second Schedule for non-earning persons is
to take the notional income as Rs. 15,000 per year. A child cannot be
equated to such a non-earning person. Therefore, the compensation is to
be worked out under the non-pecuniary heads in addition to the actual
amounts incurred for treatment done and / or to be done, transportation,
assistance of attendant, etc. &quot;The main elements of damages in the case
of child victims are the pain, shock, frustration, deprivation of
ordinary pleasures and enjoyment associated with healthy and mobile
limbs. The compensation awarded should enable the child to acquire
something or to develop a lifestyle which will offset to some extent the
inconvenience or discomfort arising out of the disability.&quot; The bench
added, &quot;Appropriate compensation for disability should take care of all
non-pecuniary damages. In other words, apart from this head, there shall
only be the claim for the actual expenditure for treatment, attendant,
transportation etc.&quot;</p>

<li>Treatment of Interest</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>So far as the higher rate
of interest stipulation is concerned, it is to be noted that grant of
interest under Section 171 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is
discretionary. The purpose for award of interest is to put pressure on
the relevant person not to delay in effecting the payment; and, to
compensate the victim or his dependents at least to some extent for such
delay as may occur, by way of interest. In determining the quantum of
interest awardable under the relevant Section 171, the Tribunal acting
under Section 166 of the 1988 Act, can derive direct guidance from
Section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. In fact, the provisions
require payment of interest in addition to compensation already
determined. Even though the expression may is used, a duty is laid on
the Tribunal to consider the question of interest separately with due
regard to the facts and circumstances of the case. The provision is
discretionary and is not and cannot be bound by rules. In Halsburys Laws
of England, 4th Edn., Vol. I, duty and discretion is explained as given
below: ―A statutory discretion is not, however, necessarily or, indeed,
usually absolute; it may be qualified by express and implied legal
duties to comply with substantive and procedural requirements before a
decision is taken whether to act and how to act. Moreover, there may be
discretion whether to exercise a power, but no discretion as to the mode
of its exercise; or a duty to act when certain conditions are present,
but discretion how to act. Discretion may thus be coupled with duties‖.</p>
<h2 id="a-discretion-as-per-rules-of-reason-and-justice">a) Discretion as per Rules of Reason and Justice</h2>
<p>As per Lord Halsbury,
L.C., in [(Sharp vs. Wakefield,) (1891) Appeal Cases 173]: When it is
said that something is to be done within the discretion of the
authorities, that something is to be done according to the rules of
reason and justice; not according to private opinion; according to law
and not humour. It is to be not arbitrary, vague, and fanciful, but
legal and regular. The discretion must be exercised within the limit, to
which an honest man, competent to the discharge duty of his office ought
to confine himself.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>a) The purpose of granting pecuniary award of damages under the
Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 is to provide to the dependents of the victim of
motor accident a capital sum, if there had not been an accident by the
careless act of the driver of a motor vehicle. b) Type of Damages: Law
contemplates two sets of damages: Pecuniary damages and non-pecuniary
damages. c) In case of simple injuries the compensation awarded is
global compensation and no separate amount is awarded for medical
expenses.. d) In case of grievous injury: Compensation for pain and
suffering is to be remunerated by awarding for injuries or fractures of
different bones. e) Loss of income during the period of treatment i.</p>
<p>Actual or notional wages or salary for the period of treatment is to be
granted. i. . Loss of future earning capacity on account of permanent
disabilities is computed when there is functional disability i. . Future
medical expenses include expenses incurred for corrective surgeries or
replacement of medical aids and equipment essential for having permanent
handicaps. iv. Future unhappiness and loss of amenities depends upon
nature of lasting disability or disfigurement. v. Loss of marital
prospects depending upon the gravity of the threat to marital prospects
vi. Loss of academic year in education can be compensated upon proof of
the actual expenses incurred for the academic year vi . Shortening of
life span as a consequence of injury may attract compensation based on
medical opinion regarding shortening of life span on account of injury
f) The Multiplier method comprised of multiplying annual dependency
amount of what deceased would have spent on the dependents by the
commonly accepted multiplier known as ‗year purchase factor&rsquo;. g) The
multiplier to be applied would be dependent on the age of the deceased
or dependent, whichever is higher. Maximum multiplier fixed at 18 as
against 16 prescribed in Susamma Thomas case. h) The multiplicand to be
applied to calculate future prospects would depend on the age of the
deceased.</p>
<p>i) Impact of Interest Rate on Multiplier: As the interest rate is on
the decline, the multiplier has to consequentially be raised. The
highest multiplier has to be for the age group of 21 years to 25 years
when an ordinary Indian citizen starts independently earning and the
lowest at 60 to 70 years, which is the normal retirement age. j) Section
163A begins with a ‗non-obstante clause&rsquo; and provides for payment of
compensation, as indicated in the Second Schedule, to the legal
representatives of the deceased or injured, as the case may be. k) The
scheme for payment of compensation under the 1988 Act can be divided as
under: i. i.</p>
<p>Section 140 for no-fault liability in case of death or disablement; .
Section 161: In case of hit-and-run motor accidents, where the identity
of the vehicle cannot be ascertained, compensation amount is Rs.
25,000/- in case of death and Rs. 12,500/- in case of grievous hurt; i.
. Section 163A: Special provisions as to payment of compensation on
structured formula basis without establishing or proving any wrongful
act or neglect or default of any person; iv. Section 168 for
determination of compensation payable in pursuance of any right on the
principle of fault liability. l) Section 163A provides for fixed amount
of general damage in case of death such as: i. Rs. 2,000/- for funeral
expenses i . Rs. 5,000/- for loss of consortium if beneficiary is the
spouse i i. Rs. 2,400/- for loss of estate iv. For medical expenses
supported by the bills, voucher not exceeding Rs. 15,000/-. m) Under
Section 161(3), in cases in respect of the death of any person resulting
from a hit-and-run motor accident, a fixed sum of Rs. 25,000/- is to be
paid as compensation and in case of grievous hurt, the amount fixed is
Rs.12,500/-. n) Section 168 of 1988 Act is required to make an award
determining the amount of compensation which is to be in the real sense
damages, which in turn appears to it to be just and reasonable. o) The
assessment of damages to compensate the dependants is beset with
difficulties because from the nature of things, it has to take into
account many imponderables. p) Treatment of Interest: Grant of interest
under Section 171 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is discretionary</p>
<h2 id="answers-to-test-yourself">Answers to Test Yourself</h2>
<p>Answer 1 The correct answer is IV. Under the
permissible heads for assessment, in case of death of a person, payment
is made for: i. Loss of dependency i . Loss of expectancy i i. Loss of
consortium iv. Funeral expenses v. Medical expenses if deceased was
given any treatment prior to fatality Answer 2 The correct option is
III. In a case where the claim was in excess of Rs. 2,000/- under the
1939 Act, the option to choose the Claims Tribunal or Civil Court lay
with the claimant. Answer 3 The correct option is I. Grant of interest
under Section 171 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is discretionary.</p>
