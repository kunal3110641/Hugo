<ol>
<li>History of Motor Insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-motor-insurance">a) Motor Insurance</h2>
<p>Motor Insurance, a fascinating branch
of insurance, had its beginnings in the United Kingdom in the early part
of the last century. The first motor car was introduced into England in
1894.</p>
<p>i.Third party liability insurance: The first motor policy was introduced
in 1895 to cover third party liabilities.</p>
<p>ii. Comprehensive insurance: By 1899, accidental damage to the car was
added to the policy, thus introducing, the ‗comprehensive&rsquo; policy along
the lines of the policy issued today. iii. First motor insurance
company: In 1903, the Car and General Insurance Corporation Ltd. was
established mainly to transact motor insurance, followed by other
companies. iv. Compulsory third party insurance: After World War I,
there was considerable increase in the number of vehicles on the road as
also in the number of road accidents. Many injured persons in road
accidents were unable to recover damages because not all motorists were
insured. This led to the introduction of compulsory third party
insurance through the passing of the Road Traffic Acts, 1930 and 1934.
The compulsory insurance provisions of these Acts have been consolidated
by the Road Traffic Act, 1960.</p>
<h2 id="b-law-and-practice-of-motor-insurance-in-india">b) Law and Practice of Motor Insurance in India</h2>
<p>i.Motor Vehicles Act, 1939: The Motor Vehicles Act was passed in 1939
introducing the law relating to compulsory third party insurance (Refer
Chapter 2).</p>
<p>ii. Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Act No. 59
of 1988) has replaced the earlier 1939 Act, and it became effective from
1st July 1989. iii. Transition from Tariff to non-Tariff: The practice
of motor insurance in India generally follows that of the UK market. The
business was governed by a Tariff till March 2008, and now like the UK
market, it is non-Tariff. However, IRDA, the Indian regulatory authority
for insurance has directed insurers in India to continue to follow the
Tariff policy wordings, principles of insurance and associated legal
aspects of Motor Insurance contracts. 2</p>
<h2 id="c-market-scenario">c) Market Scenario</h2>
<p>i.Loss ratio: According to the IRDA, the loss ratio for the industry in
201011 was 213% but fell to 145% in 2011-12. The data clearly
establishes that there is ample need to be alarmed with rate of death
being 31.6 per 100 accident cases at the National level (See details in
Chapter 7.6).</p>
<p>ii. Third-party premium rates are fixed by the insurance regulator.
IRDA increased third-party motor premium rates in 2011-12 on an average
by 58%, in 2012-13 by 15% and for 2013-14, 20%. iii. Triggers for future
growth: In the medium to long-term, increased automobile sales, higher
penetration in the renewal business and the emergence of large organised
collaborators such as ‗garage preferred&rsquo; provider networks, are expected
to provide the growth momentum for this segment.</p>
<h2 id="d-new-trends-in-motor-insurance">d) New Trends in Motor Insurance</h2>
<p>General insurance industry has seen new trends and motor
insurance is one of the chief contributors.</p>
<h2 id="iincreased-volume-of-claims">i.Increased Volume of Claims</h2>
<p>A high number of claims are to be processed in Motor TP segment. The
insurance industry has achieved a very high growth rate. ii. Lack of
Standardised Processes The industry is in strong need for benchmarking
the processes to global best practices. The online sale of standard
Motor Insurance Policies has contributed to almost 7-8 % of the total
premium so far. iii. Increased Litigation Costs The current trend is 72%
of TP claims go into litigations. A strong need is felt to have standard
compensation packages for which the insurance industry is constantly
pursuing, as it will lead to drastic reduction in number of cases going
to the Tribunals making available instant compensation to hapless
accident victims and their families and reducing the work load of
judiciary. iv. Technology The advent of newer technology has brought in
efficiency in processing claims, increased analysis is possible and a
good deal of IT security has become necessary.</p>
<p>v. Increasing Frauds The current scenario has thrown multiple claims
being made simultaneously from different insurers. This ‗forum shopping'
can be overcome by stipulating limitation period in the Act for making
claims. There is a lack of common policy database, which has the curious
situation where 70% vehicles are only insured despite mandatory
provision and Dealers are being made to ensure delivery of the vehicle
only after registration with RTA. We are in dire need to introduce some
methodology which will ensure 100% Third party insurance be it levy on
sale of petrol or Third party long term insurance enforced by RTA with
Registration of Vehicle. vi. Increased Competition As per The Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 the insurance of all motor vehicles is mandatory, if
the insurance companies arrange insurance and renewal of the insurance
policies of all these uninsured vehicles (which is their basic duty)
then the incurred claim ratio would further come down. As per the data
published by Insurance Information Bureau (<a href="https://www.iib.gov.in">www.iib.gov.in</a>) for 2012-13
for private cars and two wheelers the insurance companies are making
profit in this segment. PSU as well as private sector players and
Intermediaries pose a threat of customer ownership.</p>

<li>Applicability of Principles of Insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>A motor insurance contract has all the
ingredients of general contract in respect of insured&rsquo;s duty to disclose
material facts and insured&rsquo;s right to insure any legal interest, legal
liability or damage to third party property, besides insurer is bestowed
with the duty to indemnify and as a corollary accrues right of
subrogation and contribution.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Insurance is a contract, recognised by the law, in which the
insurer undertakes to run the risk to a pre-specified extent, subject to
terms, conditions and warrantees and pays compensation for an agreed
consideration to the insured / owner of the property on the happening of
the event insured against. A positive occurrence of the event is an
essential factor differentiating insurance contract from a wagering
contract where a profit or benefit does not accrue to either party.</p>
<h2 id="important">Important</h2>
<p>Unique Contract: Insurance of motor vehicle is unique as it
combines in itself damage to insured motor vehicle and insurance against
liability towards damage to third party property and / or any personal
injury / death sustained by third party or passengers or persons in
employment as described in the policy or arising out of the use of the
insured property. The liability part of the motor insurance cover is a
statutory duty cast by the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 by which the owner
of a motor vehicle cannot use or cause use of his vehicle in a public
place, as prescribed in Chapter XI, Section 146 (1) of the 1988 Act.
Motor insurance is a branch of Miscellaneous (Property and Casualty)
insurance and like any other contract should satisfy the aforementioned
fundamentals and also the implied principles of a contract of insurance.
These principles of insurance contract are doctrine of utmost good
faith, insurable interest, indemnity along with its corollaries
subrogation and contribution and doctrine of proximate cause. A brief
summary of the principles is discussed hereunder. a) Principle of
Uberrimae Fides in Motor Own Damage Insurance Contracts of motor
insurance are governed by the doctrine of uberrimae fides (utmost good
faith). The doctrine of utmost good faith imposes a legal obligation on
the proposer to disclose all material facts to the insurers, in order
that the parties to the contract are placed in the same position or on
an equal footing with reference to their knowledge of the subject matter
of insurance.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>In Turner vs. Green, the plaintiff was informed of an accident
but he did not disclose the same to insurer. Had the defendant been
aware of the happening of the accident, he would not have entered into a
contract at all. It would, therefore, be necessary for the proposer to
submit details of previous accidents and imposition of terms like
compulsory excess on own damage claims by the previous insurer, usage of
vehicle, geographical area of use, the physical health of the driver,
the driving history including traffic convictions of the driver. These
terms will enable the insurer to decide the acceptance of the proposal
and if necessary, will enable restriction to the scope of insurance
cover or impose restriction on driving the vehicle by named persons
only.</p>
<p>i. Contractual duty of utmost good faith: The use of „proposal form‟ is
compulsory and the „declaration clause‟ in the proposal form modifies
the „Common Law duty‟ into a „Contractual duty of utmost good faith‟.
The effect of this modification is that the answers given in the
proposal form become continuing warranties. The answers are required to
be literally true and correct. Any wrong answer, irrespective of its
materiality, will render the insurance contract voidable by insurers,
although the burden of proving concealment or misrepresentation rests on
the insurance company. b) Insurable Interest Insurable interest is the
insured&rsquo;s legal right to insure. In Motor Insurance vehicle is the
property, which is exposed to loss or damage. The insured also has a
legal liability towards third parties; he may suffer financial loss if
he incurs that liability under law through the use of the vehicle.
Therefore, the insured has insurable interest, which entitles him to
insure the vehicle against damage and liability risk. In motor insurance
following class of persons have an insurable interest in the vehicle:
Diagram 1: Class of persons having insurable interest in the vehicle</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-motor/LIFE_INSURANCE_ORGANISATION-11.png" alt="targets"></p>
<h2 id="i-owner">i. Owner</h2>
<p>The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 stipulates that the owner of a
motor vehicle shall arrange for the registration of the vehicle with the
Registering Transport Authority. For Registration of a vehicle evidence
of valid insurance in the form of a Certificate of Insurance or Cover
Note is a prerequisite to comply with the 1988 Act. Therefore, the owner
of a motor vehicle by virtue of his title and possession has an
insurable interest which must be existing throughout the ownership of a
vehicle i.e., (a) at the time of taking insurance, (b) during the
currency of the period of insurance, (c) at the time of claim and (d) at
the time of renewal of the policy</p>
<h2 id="ii-seller">ii. Seller</h2>
<p>The seller of a motor
vehicle has an insurable interest until the property, in the motor
vehicle passes on to buyer. In certain cases e.g., an unpaid vendor of
the motor vehicle can exercise the right of lien to the extent he has an
insurable interest.</p>
<h2 id="iii-buyer">iii. Buyer</h2>
<p>The buyer of motor vehicle acquires
insurable interest as soon as the contract of sale is completed, though
he may not be in possession of the vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="iv-hire-purchase">iv. Hire Purchase</h2>
<p>If a vehicle is purchased under a hire purchase agreement or lease agreement,
the financier remains owner of the vehicle and insurance should be
arranged in their name. However, Section 51 of the 1988 Act requires
registration of the vehicle in the name of user, with Owner&rsquo;s right
endorsed in the registration document. In view of this, the insurance
policy is issued in the name of the user incorporating Financiers
(Owner&rsquo;s) interest clause as per India Motor Tariff IMT 5 &amp; 6 in
consonance with general regulations number 19 &amp; 20 respectively. The
clauses provide that in respect of loss or damage to the motor vehicle
(which loss or damage is not made good by repair or replacement) the
monies shall be payable to the Owner, i.e., the Financiers. A hire
purchase financier of a motor vehicle has an insurable interest until
all the instalments are repaid. Financier is not the owner of the Motor
vehicle for the purpose of the accident which requires possession of
vehicle as the most important element in compliance of the requirement
of 1988 Act. [(Godavari Finance Co v Degala Satyanarayanamma) 2008 (5)

<h2 id="v-hypothcatee">v. Hypothcatee</h2>
<p>In hypothecation agreement, the ownership in the vehicle
is with the user only, but financiers continue to have an insurable
interest to the extent of the loan outstanding to hypothecate. A clause
is incorporated in the policy to protect the Pledgee&rsquo;s interest as per
IMT 7 in consonance with General Regulations 21 incorporating an
insurable interest to the extent of money so advanced or outstanding.
The person advancing money in respect of motor vehicle under a
hypothecation agreement remains a beneficiary.</p>
<h2 id="vi-joint-owners">vi. Joint Owners</h2>
<p>Joint owners of the vehicle or partners of a firm have insurable interest in
the Motor Vehicle as per partnership provisions.</p>
<h2 id="vii-motor-traders">vii. Motor Traders</h2>
<p>Motor traders e.g., garage proprietors have insurable interest as
baileys in respect of loss or damage to customers&rsquo; vehicle that are in
their custody for repair purpose. Motor Traders Policy covers such
liability separately. This succinctly infers that the standard motor
vehicle package / liability policy does not cover liability for loss or
damage to vehicle while the vehicle and any third party liability
accrued thereon during the period, whilst the vehicle is lying in a
garage.</p>
<h2 id="viii-hotel-owners">viii. Hotel Owners</h2>
<p>Hotel owners are baileys either for reward or
otherwise of a vehicle and as the goods held in trust / possession have
an insurable interest until the vehicle is in their possession or
entrusted by them to hotel security agency.</p>
<h2 id="ix-legal-heirs">ix. Legal Heirs</h2>
<p>Legal heirs to an intestate person, executor&rsquo;s administrators, official assignees,
official receivers have an insurable interest.</p>
<h2 id="x-user">x. User</h2>
<p>The owner insured may drive the vehicle on his own or may authorise other persons to drive
his vehicle. Strictly speaking the user is liable under common law and
law of torts to any third party liability, but the owner is deemed to
act as an Agent under 1988 Act in arranging the indemnity on behalf of
such other persons who may drive the vehicle with his permission and
incur liability.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the injured third parties will have no recourse to recover
damages. Under Section 146 of the M.V. Act 1988, no person shall allow
any other person to use his vehicle in a public place, unless the
vehicle is covered by an insurance policy complying with the
requirements of the 1988 Act.</p>
<h2 id="c-indemnity">c) Indemnity</h2>
<p>Insurance contracts are
contracts of indemnity, that is to say, the insured is placed after
loss, as far as possible, in the same position as he was immediately
before the loss. This principle ensures that the insured does not make a
profit out of his loss. In motor insurance principle of indemnity is
applied in following ways:</p>
<h2 id="i-total-loss-tl--constructive-total-loss-ctl--theft-claims">i. Total Loss (TL) / Constructive Total Loss (CTL) / Theft Claims</h2>
<p>For TL / CTL / Theft claims, the principle of
Insured&rsquo;s Declared Value (IDV) is applied. IDV does not take into
consideration market value or depreciated value of the vehicle. It is
the sum insured agreed at the commencement of the policy between insurer
and the insured, based on manufacturers&rsquo; price of new vehicle at the
commencement of the policy period subject to depreciation at agreed
rates as provided in the Motor policy document. IDV remains constant
throughout the policy period and will not be subjected to further
depreciation for TL / CTL / Theft claims during the policy period.</p>
<h2 id="ii-repair-claims">ii. Repair Claims</h2>
<p>In case of claims for repair of the vehicle, the indemnity
is computed on the cost of parts replaced less depreciation, taking into
consideration the nature of parts, age and usage of the vehicle. The
depreciation table for repairs as per General Regulation 9 of India
Motor Tariff is different from the one applicable for TL / CTL / Theft
losses as per General Regulation 8.</p>
<h2 id="iii-third-party-liability">iii. Third Party Liability</h2>
<p>In respect of Third Party liability, the incurred damages are awarded
including the interest component as indemnity, including the limits of
liability for Personal Accident (PA) owner driver claims as specified in
the policy. The Policy also provides indemnity for legal costs as
awarded.</p>
<h2 id="d-doctrine-of-subrogation-and-contribution">d) Doctrine of Subrogation and Contribution</h2>
<p>i.Subrogation</p>
<p>Subrogation is the transfer of rights from the insured to the insurer
when the loss or damage to the vehicle is caused by the negligence of
another person. Insurers&rsquo; exercise the rights to recover the loss from
the person so responsible under common law. The doctrine of subrogation
operates only IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>after the claim is paid. A policy condition, however, provides for
subrogation before the payment of the claim. In the case of theft of
parts from a private car, the insurers are entitled to the stolen parts
when recovered, by virtue of the application of the doctrine of
subrogation. In practice, however, subrogation stands modified by Knock
for Knock Agreement (Chapter 2) between insurers. The insured is
required to extend full cooperation and join the insurer as co-plaintiff
in any legal suit of recovery. In case the insured himself recovers
damages through legal proceedings without any assistance from the
insurer and perchance the insurer has settled the claim, the insurer
will be entitled to the benefit of recovery so made by the insured to
the extent of amount of claims paid. ii. Contribution Contribution
arises when there is double insurance (refer GR.24), that is, when the
same vehicle is insured under two policies. According to the policy
condition, the loss is shared pro-rata between the two insurers. The
industry needs to clarify whether the liability be precluded if there
were no instruction by the owner insured but the instructions were given
by some other family member? The contribution condition needs to be
specially worded in Private Car Policies to cover the owner of the motor
vehicle, for third party liability while driving cars not belonging to
him. e) Proximate Cause The doctrine of proximate cause applies to motor
insurance similar to other classes of insurance. The loss or damage to
the vehicle is indemnified only if it is proximately caused by any of
the insured perils. The doctrine also applies to third party claims. The
third party injury or damage must be proximately caused by the use of
the vehicle, by or on the instructions of the insured, for which he is
held legally liable to pay damages.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-1">Test Yourself 1</h2>
<p>Which of the following statement is correct with regards
to insurable interest of partners in a motor vehicle? I. Partners always
have equal insurable interest in the motor vehicle II. Partners have
insurable interest in the motor vehicle as per the partnership
provisions III. As per the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, the
partner with the highest stake in the partnership always has the entire
insurable interest in the motor vehicle IV. As per the provisions of the
Partnership Act, the partner with the highest stake in the partnership
always has the entire insurable interest in the motor vehicle</p>
<h2 id="b-legal-aspects-of-insurance-and-the-motor-vehicles-amendment-bill-2008">B. Legal Aspects of Insurance and The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2008</h2>
<p>Legal Aspects of Insurance The practice of motor insurance is
influenced, to a large extent, by the erstwhile Motor Vehicle Act, 1939
which came into force in July 1939. This Act made provision for various
matters relating to: i. The use, maintenance and operation of motor
vehicles, i . Registration of motor vehicles, ii. . Construction
equipment and maintenance of motor vehicles, iv. Control of traffic,
etc. Chapter VII-A and Chapter VIII of the Act 1939 provided for
insurance of motor vehicles against third party risks under the
provisions of Chapter VIII brought into force from 1st July, 1946 and
those of Chapter VII-A made effective from 1st October 1982. The Motor
Vehicles Act, 1939 (No. 4 of 1939) was amended several times to keep it
up to date. A need was; however, felt that this law should take into
account also the: i. Changes in the Road Transport Technology, i .
Pattern of passenger and Freight movements, i i. Development of road
network and particularly iv. The improved techniques in Motor vehicles
management Various Committees like the National Transport Policy
Committee, National Police Commission, Road Safety Committee, Low
Powered Two-Wheelers Committee, as also the Law Commission went into the
different aspects of road transport recommending updation,
simplification and rationalisation of the law. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>A working Group was, therefore, constituted in January, 1984 to review
the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and to submit draft
proposals for suitable legislation to replace the existing Act.</p>
<ol>
<li>Act No. 59 of 1988 (The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988)</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>In 1985, General Insurance
Corporation appointed a Committee of experts which examined the
provisions of the MV Act 1939 thoroughly and submitted to the Central
Government an exhaustive report suggesting constructive amendments to
the Act. It had recommended removal of certain disparities with regard
to the liability of the insurer to pay compensation depending upon the
class or type of vehicle involved in the accident. The Motor Vehicles
Act, 1988 (Act No. 59 of 1988) is the outcome of all the recommendations
proposed by various Committees. It has replaced the earlier 1939 Act and
it became effective from 1st July, 1989. a) Important provisions of the
1988 Act i. Rationalisation of certain definitions with additions of
certain new definitions of new types of vehicles. ii. Stricter
procedures for grant of driving licences and period of their validity.
iii. Laying down of standards for the components and parts of motor
vehicles iv. Standards for anti-pollution control devices. v. Provision
for issuing fitness certificates of vehicles also by the authorised
testing stations. vi. Enabling provision for updating the system of
registration marks. vii. Liberalised schemes for grant of All-India
Tourist permits as also national permits for goods carriages. viii.
Administration of Solatium Fund by General Insurance Corporation ix.
Maintenance of State registers for driving licenses and vehicle
registration. x. Constitution of Road Safety Councils. xi. Seeking to
provide for more deterrent punishment in cases of certain offences.</p>
<p>b) Amendment Act 54 of 1994 The Act of 1988 was amended vide Amendment
Act 54 of 1994 which consolidated and rationalised various laws
regulating road transport. i. Modification and amplification of certain
definitions of new type of vehicles; ii. Simplification of procedure for
grant of driving licences; iii. Putting restrictions on the alteration
of vehicles; iv. Certain exemptions for vehicles running on
non-polluting fuels; Amendments were made for make special provisions
under Sections 66 &amp; 67 so as to provide that vehicles operating on
eco&ndash;friendly fuels shall be exempted from the requirements of permits
and also the owners of such vehicles shall have the discretion to fix
fares and freights for carriage of passengers and goods. The intention
in bringing the said amendments was to encourage the operation of
vehicles with such eco-friendly fuels. v. Ceilings on individuals or
company holdings removed to curb ―benami‖ holdings; vi. States
authorised to appoint one or more State Transport Appellate Tribunals;
vii. Punitive checks on the use of such components that do not conform
to the prescribed standards by manufactures, and also stocking / sale by
the traders; viii. Increase in the amount of compensation of the victims
of hit and run cases; ix. Removal of time limit for filling of
application victims for compensation;</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>road</p>
<p>accident</p>
<p>x. Punishment in case of certain offences is made stringent; xi. A new
pre-determined formula for payment of compensation to road accident
victims on the basis of age / income, which is more liberal and
rational. The Law Commission in its 119th Report had recommended that
every application for a claim be made: i. To the Claims Tribunal having
jurisdiction over the area in which the accident occurred or IC-72 MOTOR
INSURANCE</p>
<p>. To the Claims Tribunal within the local limits jurisdiction the
claimant resides or carries on business or</p>
<p>i. Within the local limits of whose resides, at the option of the
claimant.</p>
<p>c) Amendment Act 27 of 2000 set to reduce the vehicular pollution and
to ensure the safety of the road users. Therefore, Act prohibited
alteration of vehicles in any manner including change of tyres of higher
capacity. However, the alteration of vehicles with a view to
facilitating the use of eco-friendly fuel including Liquefied Petroleum
Gas (LPG) is being permitted. d) Amendment Act 39 of 2001 considered it
essential to remove exemption provided under Sections 66 and 67 of the
said Act to CNG operated vehicles so that vehicles which operate on
eco-friendly fuels are also covered by the terms and conditions
applicable to all other vehicles. Power of licensing authority to

</ol>
<p>i.Chapter X Sections 140 to 144 of the MV 1988 Act deal with &ldquo;Liability
without Fault in Certain Cases&rdquo;. (Dealt in the Act 1939 under Chapter

<p>Section 56 of the 1988 Act: if
the fitness of the vehicle had expired before the date of accident, the
vehicle shall not be deemed to be registered under Section 39 of 1988
Act (Central Motor Vehicle Rules 52 for renewal of certificate of
registration and Rule 62 for the validity of the Certificate of
Fitness). d) Permit Section 66 (1) of the Act 1988 Necessity for permits
(see 3 a) below). e) Certificate of Insurance The 1988 Act requires
issue of a Certificate of Insurance by the insurers as proof of Third
Party insurance to satisfy the requirements of Chapter XI of the Act.
The Certificate of Insurance (Form 51) must be in the form prescribed
under the Motor Vehicle Rules framed under the Act. Certificate is to be
issued by ―Authorised Insurer and Authorised Government Insurance Fund‖
who are authorised to be do general insurance business in India. 18</p>
<p>Certificate of insurance includes Cover Note and Policy of Insurance
includes ―Certificate of Insurance‖. Certificate of Insurance is to be
produced when demanded by traffic police / Road Traffic Authority. f)
Transfer of Certificate of Insurance The motor Insurance Policy is a
personal Contract and is underwritten on the basis of purpose and manner
of use of vehicle besides the physical features, therefore, the Policy
cannot be transferred without the consent of the insurer insofar as it
does not counter the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act 1988. Section
157 provides for the provisions for the transfer of certificate of
insurance as hereunder: (1) The Certificate of Insurance automatically
gets transferred to the transferee once the ownership is changed. (2)
The Transferee shall apply within 14 days to the insurer to insert his
name in the Certificate of insurance. Section 157 (1) states that such
deemed transfer, shall include transfer of rights and liabilities of the
said certificate of Insurance and Policy of Insurance. Under Section 157
of the Act, on transfer of ownership of the Vehicle, the Certificate of
Insurance is automatically transferred in favour of new owner from the
date of transfer of ownership of the vehicle. However, Supreme Court of
India has held in 1996 that the automatic transfer is only for Third
Party risks and not the full policy where policy covers insurance of Own
damage i.e., damage to the vehicle cover. The transfer of insurance
under Own damage section takes place transferee should apply within 14
days from the date of transfer in the prescribed form to the insurer for
making the necessary changes in the ‗Certificate of Insurance&rsquo; and in
the Policy, and the insurer is obliged to make such changes in the said
documents to give effect to the transfer of insurance. Now, under
changed IMT as of 1/7/2002 GR 17 has come into force, as per this rule,
14 days period is stipulated for the transfer of contract of insurance.
Hence, as of 1/7/2002, unless the policy of insurance was transferred in
the name of purchaser, the insurer may not be liable for the OD claim.
g) Grace period for OD claims Here also, TAC has clarified that during
the 14 days period, it can be construed as grace period and insurers can
consider OD claims, even if the contract of insurance was not
transferred as on date of accident. In respect of Third Party claims, be
it under the earlier IMT dispensation or the present one, insurers would
be liable vide Sec.157 of MV Act, 1988.</p>

<h2 id="c-positive-effect-on-the-traffic-flow">c) Positive effect on the traffic flow</h2>
<p>The motorists should be more careful while driving. Driving safely is
the only way to control accident and related person and property losses.
The trend worldwide shows that people become more cautious when the
fines are high. The bill, drafted by the road transport ministry, has
made penalties for traffic offences much more stringent.</p>
<p>Dangerous driving and not wearing seat belts or helmets will also
attract higher punishment. Rash driving for example is now likely to
attract a civil liability of up to Rs. 5,000 in addition to punishment
under the Indian Penal Code.</p>
<p>ii. Driving drunk, jumping the lights, speeding, and use of mobile
phones behind the wheel will attract higher fines and jail terms as
envisaged under new rules. The proposed rules also include substantial
hikes in compensation to accident victims. Drunk driving will attract a
penalty of Rs. 5,000 and a two-year jail term. iii. For the first time,
a concept of graded fines for drunk driving is likely to be introduced.
This means that penalty will be directly proportional to the alcohol
content found above the stipulated limit of up to 30 mg per 100 ml of
blood in the driver's body.</p>

<li>Procedure for Accreditation of Bus Body Builders</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>During the last two decades, there
has been an exponential growth in the number of automobiles in India.
The rate of the growth is manifold in personalised vehicles as compared
to public transport vehicles. Unfortunately, number of roads and road
space has not increased in tandem with the growth of vehicular
population. This situation has posed a serious challenge to Road Safety
and Environment. During the last 20 years, efforts are on, under the
aegis of Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport &amp; Highways India to bring
in new regulations to enhance safety. Bus Body Building and Truck Body
Building is carried out not only by a few well organised sectors but
also largely by Small Scale Industries and even road side garages. There
is a need to implement Bus Body Code and Bus Body Building Accreditation
System to ensure building of buses as per the stipulated safety norms.
In order to implement Bus Body Builders Accreditation System, there is a
need to establish a proper system for the effective implementation.
Government of India has notified &ldquo;Central Motor Vehicles (Accreditation
for Bus Body Builders) Order, 2007 and notified in Gazette of India,
Notification No. S.O.425(E) dated 23rd March, 2007). As per the
notification, all the Bus Body Building units will have to obtain
accreditation certificate to demonstrate their capabilities to build
buses as per the safety norms. Bus Body Code, Testing and approval for
the body building of buses AIS: 052 and Testing and approval for the
body building of school buses AIS:063 was notified vide Notification No.

Highlights of the Bill The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is the principal
legislation by which road transport is regulated in the country. The Act
was amended thrice, in 1994, 2000, and 2001 in response to technological
changes. The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2008 seeks to amend the
Principal Act by i. i.</p>
<p>Enhancing fines, . Devolving greater powers to state governments to
regulate road transport, i. . Streamlining provisions dealing with the
payment of compensation to road accident victims, and iv. Prescribing a
time bound process for disposal of appeals Enhancing fines: The proposed
Bill enhances penalties for offences, and provides different penalties
for first and subsequent violations. Increased powers to State
Governments: The Bill gives increased powers to state governments in
matters such as regulating Stage and Contract carriages, in regulating
Service Operators, and creation of Authorised Testing Stations.
Automobile associations recognised by State Governments shall be allowed
to issue driving certificates. Those holding driving certificates may be
exempted from a driving test for the issue of a license. Change in
awarding compensation for motor accident claims: The Bill changes the
method of awarding compensation for motor accident claims. If IC-72
MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>the fault of the driver is sought to be established, the claim shall be
decided by the civil court or Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. If the
claimant does not seek to establish the fault of the driver,
compensation shall be based on the victim&rsquo;s income and age. Suspension
of licence: Any authority empowered to check a driver&rsquo;s license can
suspend it on the spot if the driver fails a breath analyser test. The
courts have the power to estimate and award compensation for motor
accident cases where the driver&rsquo;s fault is established. The Bill
introduces a fine for rash and negligent driving. The Standing Committee
recommended an additional increase in the term of imprisonment provided
under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The Bill seeks to make a consignor
liable for over-loading of goods. Several countries seek to make only
the driver or the owner liable. Key Features: The key changes proposed
by the Bill are compared with the existing provisions of Motor Vehicles
Act, 1988. Comparison of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 Motor Vehicles
(Amendment) Bill, 2007 is given hereunder: i.</p>
<p>Offences where fine has been stipulated: Fines ranging from Rs. 100 to
Rs. 5,000 have been enhanced to Rs. 500 to Rs. 20,000. Other violations
of the Act: Maximum fine of Rs. 300 has been increased to Rs. 1,000 (for
initial offences) and Rs. 5,000 (for subsequent offences).</p>
<p>ii. Licensing authority: The sole licensing authority in the current
Act 1988 is the Regional Transport Office, which conducts driving tests
and then issues licenses. The amendment propose State Government to
authorise automobile associations and institutions to issue driving
certificates which may exempt a person from a driving test for getting a
driving license. iii. Time for disposal of appeals: No time limit is
specified for disposing of appeals as yet. The amendment proposes the
appeals to be disposed of within a period of 45 to 60 days. In the event
of not doing so, reasons have to be recorded in writing. iv. Powers of
state governments: The state government has the power to: (a) Regulate
the plying of carriages under directions from the central government,
(b) Issue licenses as per rules prescribed by the central government,
(c) Set up licensing and registering authorities as per the framework
mandated by the central government 30
Powers have been proposed to be enhanced to regulate the plying of stage
and contract carriages independently. Lay down quality of service rules
for operators. Enter into agreements for inter-state road transport
services without the approval of the central government. Allow the
Transport Authority to grant special permits for plying of stage
carriages outside the jurisdiction of that Transport Authority. v.
Compensation for Motor vehicle accidents: Without establishing the fault
of the driver (NFL) fixed compensation is provided at of Rs. 25,000
(death), Rs. 12,500 (permanent disablement). Establishing the fault of
the driver is to be calculated according to the guidelines of Second
Schedule, based on victim&rsquo;s age and income. The schedule is proposed to
be amended based on victim&rsquo;s age and income. Establishing the fault of
the driver is to be awarded by the court or the Motor Vehicles Tribunal
by providing a simple interest of up to two percent per annum from the
date of the claim. vi. Rash and negligent driving: Penalty under Section
279 and 304A of the IPC applies but the Offence is not recognised under
the Motor Vehicles Act. However, the amendment recognises this offence
and imposes a fine, as well as payment of compensation to victims. vii.
Solatium Fund: A Solatium Scheme of 1989 existed under Section 163 of
the Act, to disburse compensation to victims of motor accident cases.
The amendment proposes to delete Section 163, and provisions for
establishing a Solatium Scheme have been introduced, under the
supervision of the Central Government and the Insurance Regulatory and
Development Authority. ―The chapter deals with the Scheme for Solatium
Fund and procedure to claim compensation for hit and run cases of
accident caused by Motor vehicles driven in public place.‖ The Central
Government in exercise of powers conferred by Section 163 (1) of the
Motor Vehicles Act 1988 (59 of 1988) vide S.O. 440 (E) dated 12 June
1989 has made a scheme for payment of compensation to the victims of hit
and run motor accidents. This scheme is called „The Solatium Scheme
1989‟. Section 161 of 1988 Act defines hit and run motor accidents to
mean an accident arising out of use of a motor vehicle whose identity
cannot be ascertained despite reasonable efforts for the purpose of
establishing legal liability under Section 166 for negligence and NFL
under Section 140.</p>
<p>LEGAL ASPECTS OF INSURANCE AND THE MOTOR VEHICLES (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2008</p>
<p>The Solatium scheme specifies the manner in which the scheme shall be
administered by the General Insurance Corporation, the form, manner and
the time within which applications for compensation may be made, the
officers or authorities to whom such applications may be made, the
procedure to be followed by such officers or authorities for considering
and passing orders on such applications, and all other matters connected
with, or incidental to, administration of the scheme and the payment of
compensation. Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill 2007 has proposed Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority to administer The Solatium Scheme.
(2) Prescribes that a scheme made under sub-section (1) provides that
Section 163 (a) a contravention of any provision, thereof, shall be
punishable with imprisonment for such term as may be specified but in no
case exceeding three months, or with fine which may extend to such
amount as may be specified but in no case exceeding five hundred rupees
or with both; (b) the powers, functions or duties conferred or imposed
on any officer or authority by such scheme may be delegated with the
prior approval in writing of the Central Government, by such officer or
authority to any other officer or authority; (c) Any provision of such
scheme may operate with retrospective effect from a date not earlier
than the date of establishment of the Solatium Fund under the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1939, (4 of 1939.) as it stood immediately before the
commencement of this Act: Provided that no such retrospective effect
shall be given so as to prejudicially affect the interests of any person
who may be governed by such provision. Procedure for making the claims
application: Rule 20 of Solatium Scheme 1989 envisages an application to
be filed in Form I [clause 20 (I)] before ‗Claims Enquiry Officer&rsquo; of
the Sub Division in which the accident has taken place. Therefore,
Claims Tribunal has no jurisdiction as held in New India Assurance
Company Ltd vs. Rajendra Prasad Bhati &amp; ors. [2002 ACJ 1762]. The
application has to be made within 6 months from the date of accident.
Procedure to be followed by the Claims Enquiry Officer: On receipt of
claims application, the Claims Enquiry Officer shall immediately obtain
a copy of the F.I.R. inquest report, post mortem report, or certificate
of injury and hold enquiry in respect of claims arising out of hit and
run motor accidents. Claims Enquiry Officer is required to decide the
rightful claimants and to submit a report to ‗Claims Settlement
Commissioner‟ in Form III [Clause 20 (1) (B) 2] within one month along
with duly discharged Form II [Clause 20 (1)] and an under taking in
Form IV [Clause 22 (1)] along with his recommendation. 32</p>
<p>The Claims Settlement Commissioner is required to sanction the claim
within 15 days and communicate the sanction to insurance company&rsquo;s
nominated officer. The Legal representatives of the deceased / injured
person are required to submit a certificate under Section 162 of Motor
Vehicles Act 1988 as per Form V {Clause 20 (1)]. viii. Insurance
companies‟ defenses: Insurance companies could not be parties to claims
in motor vehicle accidents but they can become parties to motor accident
claims, but only with the permission of the Tribunal / Court. Some
additional defenses have also been provided in the proposed amendment.
b) Part B: Key Issues and Analysis i.</p>
<p>Suspension of license for drunken driving</p>
<p>Any authority authorised to check the driving license of a driver shall
be empowered to suspend the driving license of a person on the spot for
a period up to three months, if the driver fails a breath-analyser test.
Under the existing provisions of the Act, the power to suspend the
licenses is with the licensing authority and the court. ii. Compensation
for motor accidents Currently, if the fault or negligence of the driver
is established, the court or Tribunal awards compensation by using the
Second Schedule (based on average annual income, age and life
expectancy). The Bill replaces this mechanism, and proposes that where
the fault or negligence of the driver is established, the compensation
shall be estimated by the court or the Tribunal. However, no guidelines
or framework for calculating compensation have been provided. This could
lead to a wide divergence across courts in compensation paid for similar
cases. The Supreme Court had given certain guidelines while pointing out
some anomalies in the existing Schedule. However, since those sections
of the Act are being replaced, the applicability of the judgment to the
proposed provision is unclear. In cases where the driver&rsquo;s fault is not
established, the Principal Act specifies the amount of compensation. The
Bill changes this method, and proposes to use a formula based on the
income of the victim multiplied by a factor (which is specified
according to his age). This implies that there is no upper limit on the
quantum of compensation which may be awarded, even if the driver can
prove that he was not at fault.</p>
<p>LEGAL ASPECTS OF INSURANCE AND THE MOTOR VEHICLES (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2008</p>
<p>Alternatives to proposed penalties: The Standing Committee and the Law
Commission of India have recommended that for exceeding the speed limit
or drunken driving, the penalty should be based on incremental slabs.
Slabs suggested for drunken-driving Speed of the vehicle</p>
<p>Penalty</p>
<p>20% more than speed limit 50% more than speed limit 100% more than speed
limit and beyond</p>
<p>Rs. 500</p>
<p>Quantity of Alcohol in the body 30-60 mg per 100 ml of blood</p>
<p>Rs. 1000</p>
<p>60-150 mg per 100 ml of blood</p>
<p>Cancellation of the License and held under Section 184 of the Act</p>
<p>Quantity exceeding 150 mg and above</p>
<p>Penalty Rs. 2000 Rs. 4,000/- and / or imprisonment Rs. 5,000 and
imprisonment with a provision for cancellation of license</p>
<p>Other countries follow a system of awarding de-merit points in addition
to fines / other penalties. Accumulation of a certain number of
de-merits points within a certain period of time leads to the
cancellation of the driving license. Some other Acts specify the minimum
rank of the officer who can take certain actions. For example, Sections
129 and 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 states that the
empowered officer shall not be below a certain rank. iii. Provisions
related to rash and negligent driving The Bill introduces a penalty for
rash and negligent driving, along with a compensation mechanism for
victims of road accidents. Currently, the penalty prescribed under
Section 279 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 is a fine of up to Rs.
1,000/- and / or imprisonment up to six months. The Bill proposes a
further fine of up to Rs. 5,000/- which will be deposited in the
Solatium Fund. Some countries prescribe penalties ranging from heavy
fines to revocation of the license in addition to prosecution for any
injury or destruction to property. The Standing Committee recommended
that existing legislation should also be amended to treat deaths caused
by drunken driving as culpable homicide not amounting to murder.</p>
<p>iv. Consignor liability for exceeding weight limits Presently, the
driver or the owner of a vehicle exceeding the stipulated weight limit
is deemed to have committed an offence. The Bill seeks to impose
additional liability on the consignor of the goods in some cases. Many
countries impose liability only on the driver or the owner of the
vehicle for exceeding the prescribed weight limit. Practice of other
countries with regard to imposing liability for exceeding weight limit:
Penalty imposed in United Kingdom: A person who fails to comply with
regulations regarding size and weight and the load to be carried by them
is held guilty. United States: Several states make the driver and / or
the owner liable for the vehicle exceeding the weight-limit. New
Zealand: Hold a person operating a motor vehicle or a combination of
vehicles guilty for exceeding weight limits. Canada: Both the driver and
the owner of the vehicle (if the two are different) shall be held
liable. Philippines: No specific person is mentioned. Any vehicle with
excess load is fined.</p>
<p>Test Yourself 2 In case of private cars, driving license of persons
above the age of 50 years would be . I. Renewed for lifetime on payment
of prescribed fees II. Renewed for a year at a time on payment of
prescribed fees III. Renewed for a period of three years at a time on
payment of prescribed fees IV. Renewed for a period of five years at a

<h2 id="summary">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Summary a) The Motor Vehicles Act was passed in 1939 introducing the law
relating to compulsory third party insurance in India. b) The Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 (Act No. 59 of 1988) has replaced the earlier 1939
Act, and it became effective from 1st July 1989. c) A motor insurance
contract has all the ingredients of general contract in respect of
insured&rsquo;s duty to disclose material facts and insured&rsquo;s right to insure
any legal interest, legal liability or damage to third party property,
besides insurer is bestowed with the duty to indemnify and as a
corollary accrues right of subrogation and contribution. d) Insurance of
motor vehicle is unique as it combines in itself damage to insured motor
vehicle and insurance against liability towards damage to third party
property and / or any personal injury / death sustained by third party
or passengers or persons in employment as described in the policy or
arising out of the use of the insured property. e) Contracts of motor
insurance are governed by the doctrine of uberrimae fides (utmost good
faith). f) The use of ‗proposal form&rsquo; is compulsory and the ‗declaration
clause&rsquo; in the proposal form modifies the ‗Common Law duty&rsquo; into a
‗Contractual duty of utmost good faith&rsquo;. g) In motor insurance following
class of persons have an insurable interest in the vehicle: Owner,
Seller, Buyer, Hire Purchase, Hypothcatee, Joint Owners, Motor Traders,
Hotel Owners, Legal Heirs, User h) In practice, in motor insurance
subrogation stands modified by Knock for Knock Agreement between
insurers. i) The contribution condition needs to be specially worded in
Private Car Policies to cover the owner of the motor vehicle, for third
party liability while driving cars not belonging to him. j) The loss or
damage to the vehicle is indemnified only if it is proximately caused by
any of the insured perils. The doctrine also applies to third party
claims. The third party injury or damage must be proximately caused by
the use of the vehicle, by or on the instructions of the insured, for
which he is held legally liable to pay damages.</p>
