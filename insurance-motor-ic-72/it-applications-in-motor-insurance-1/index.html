<ol>
<li>IT Intervention and Competition</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>IT is playing an ever greater role in insurance companies'
growth, with the help of specific technologies. There is bound to be
more pressure on the industry over the coming years from greater
competition, ever-more-fickle consumers and increased regulation.
Success in the insurance industry is expected to come from two areas
viz. i. Cloud and i . Analytics</p>
<h2 id="a-cloud-based-systems-and-solutions">a) Cloud-based systems and solutions</h2>
<p>A rare opportunity exists to broadly transform technology, replacing core
engines with fully integrated, cost-effective cloud-based systems for
distribution, underwriting, product development and claims. Investing in
cloud-based approaches to core insurance systems is bound to help reduce
operating costs, increase data access and improve speed to market. The
availability of cloud-based solutions both from third-party sites, as
well as internal private cloud initiatives are going to help a great
deal in reducing development time and the need for upgrades. It will
also provide access to best practices that cloud providers have
gradually baked into their solutions. But many companies running their
own data centers need to approach this opportunity in a gradual,
deliberate fashion. Switching over to cloud for cloud's sake from a
well-functioning, on-premises system just wouldn't make sense, and is a
path fraught with issues.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Importance of Analytics and IT Intervention</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-analytics-vs-analysis">a) Analytics vs. Analysis</h2>
<p>Analytics is the discovery and communication
of meaningful patterns in data, especially valuable in areas rich with
recorded information. Analytics relies on the simultaneous application
of statistics, computer programming and operations research to quantify
performance and often favors data visualisation to communicate insight.
Business firms commonly apply analytics to business data to describe,
predict and improve business performance. Specifically, arenas within
analytics include: i.</p>
<p>Enterprise decision management,</p>
<p>i . Retail analytics,</p>
<p>ii. . Marketing optimisation and marketing mix analytics, iv. Web
analytics, v. Wales force sizing and optimisation, vi. Price and
promotion modeling, vi . Predictive science, vii. . Credit risk
analysis, and ix. Fraud analytics Since analytics can require extensive
computation, the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the
most current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics.
Analytics is a two-sided coin: i.</p>
<p>On one side, it uses descriptive and predictive models to gain valuable
knowledge from data - data analysis.</p>
<p>i . On the other, analytics uses this insight to recommend action or to
guide decision making - communication. Thus, analytics is not so much
concerned with individual analyses or analysis steps, but with the
entire methodology. With the increased use of mobile communications, the
stage is set for insurers to develop more meaningful and mutually
beneficial relationships with policyholders. In auto / motor insurance,
where advances in machineto-machine (M2M) communication, or telematics
are spreading across the marketplace, generating data to more precisely
assess risk and reward for policyholders who adhere to safe driving
practices needs utmost attention. The auto manufacturers are providing
connected vehicle services to discerning customers like i.</p>
<p>GPS,</p>
<p>i . Emergency notification, i i. Roadside assistance, iv. Concierge
services and v. Other offerings IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>Today, devices self-installed or plugged into a vehicle&rsquo;s onboard
diagnostics (OBD) port, or professionally-installed black boxes,
transmit driving behavior and mileage data directly to insurers&rsquo; back
offices. As a result, many insurers&rsquo; and brokers worldwide are
leveraging telematics data to create more precise rating variables that
underpin new usage-based insurance (UBI) products. This represents a sea
change in policy underwriting, where models have traditionally assessed
risk and determined premiums based on group behavior (typically
demographics-based) and proxy variables such as credit scores. As
insurers&rsquo; risk models become more sophisticated through the use of
analytics applied to usage-based insurance UBI-generated data, a more
precise driver profile will emerge. Analytics will also streamline and
automate claims processes with real-time alerts and triggers, further
reducing expenses for the insurer and validating a better segmented book
of business. b) IT Intervention and Data Analytics</p>
<p>Diagram 1: Key Areas in data analytics</p>
<p><img src="/images/ic-motor/IT_Application_in_Motor_Insurance_61.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>On the data analytics side insurers must take good care of their data
assets, and establish a strategy and architecture that will enable
faster and morerelevant analysis. The key areas are enterprise
intelligence, enhanced analytics, predictive analytics, data governance
and data security. Each of these are discussed below:</p>
<h2 id="ienterprise-intelligence">i.Enterprise Intelligence</h2>
<p>Insurer is required to establish enterprise intelligence through common
standards and policies under a common architecture. Important data no
longer just comes out of the central relational database; it will come
from many sources, such as sensors and social media.</p>
<h2 id="ii-enhanced-analytics">ii. Enhanced Analytics</h2>
<p>Enhanced analytics can capture data from all sources and turn
it into information that's relevant to the business.</p>
<h2 id="iii-predictive-analytics">iii. Predictive Analytics</h2>
<p>Predictive analytics from this data will serve many parts of
the organisation, from fraud detection to underwriting to product
development including claims processing.</p>
<h2 id="iv-data-governance">iv. Data Governance</h2>
<p>Data only can be turned into something of value if the business has full faith and
trust in it. Cross-enterprise committees, centers of excellence or the
appointment of data stewards will help make sure everyone understands
and can benefit from the data that is available.</p>
<h2 id="v-data-security">v. Data Security</h2>
<p>Data is the most critical asset any organisation can have, and it is the very
foundation of anything insurance companies have to offer to the market.
Insurers must invest in best practices and technology to protect it.</p>
<h2 id="c-the-new-data-driven-insurer">c) The new Data-Driven Insurer</h2>
<p>Data accumulation has never been a challenge for the insurance industry, but spurred by a more intensely competitive
market and better, affordable technology, insurers are embracing
data-driven decision-making for more effective marketing, pricing and
loss reduction. Insurers are yet to realise shifting from cost cutting
measures, to more ambitious technology interventions intended to assist
competitive initiatives and drive efficiencies. The emphasis has to be
decidedly on projects intended to confer strategic advantages and
differentiation, as most insurers are heading for transformation and
growth. The insurers will have to leverage the assets they are flooded
with i.e., ―data‖ - to take better decisions in marketing, pricing and
claim settlement besides fraud management.</p>
<p>Insurers have so far identified: i. Analytics, i . Business
intelligence, i i. Data warehousing and iv. Big data All of the above
intend to help insurers make better use of the data they have, access
newly available data and make better, more informed decisions to find
opportunities, price them more effectively and reduce losses. Analytics
can be used to target the right people with the right message at the
right time. Computer processing power, third-party data and analytics
are maturing and becoming less expensive. &quot;All of that is making
analytics truly worthwhile.&quot; The rise of digital media, in addition to
offering new channels to reach consumers, enables insurers to collect
customer-response data almost instantly, measure and understand the
effectiveness of marketing efforts, and quickly adjust them to increase
their effectiveness. Role of Insurance Information Bureau (IIB): IRDA is
laying special emphasis on the use of analytics in the industry for
better structuring and pricing of policies. &quot;IRDA has backed up a
Insurance Information Bureau of India (IIB) for collating data from the
industry and then analysing them&quot;. IIB would become self-reliant after
a certain time once it started to sell analysed information to the
insurance companies both in India and abroad. The sale of some bad
policies had resulted in negative growth in the industry in the last few
years forcing the regulator to intervene to bring back confidence to the
market.</p>
<h2 id="d-predictive-analytics-in-claims">d) Predictive Analytics in Claims</h2>
<p>Predictive analytics is not
just for fraud management in insurance industry anymore, but the same
can extend into other areas of Claims Management such as i. Surveyors
and Loss Adjusters assignment, i . Loss-adjustment expense and ii. .
Decision-support However, there are several challenges to overcome.
Predictive analytics has been proven to improve claims-fraud management,
and over past several years it has played an important role in evolving
pricing by insurers. Besides fraud claims and pricing, insurance experts
are now identifying newer opportunities to apply predictive analytics in
the claims process which could trigger big changes in the industry.</p>
<p>There are indications that disruption may be starting to build from a
claims standpoint in insurance industry. The claims themselves are
becoming both more complex and better adapted to increased automation.
More complexities mean a claim, when it's for an automobile that's
been designed either not to be repaired for partial losses or not to
have an accident at all, the pricing is bound to become more rigorous.
i.</p>
<p>How will insurers tend to adjust for such non repairable accident
claims?</p>
<p>i . How insurers are going to handle such no accident vehicles on road?
Applying predictive analytics in claims especially with Surveyours and
Loss adjuster assignments, insurers can control staffing in Motor
Verticals and over all claims costs. Insurers have to ensure that they
have placed right people focused on the right decisions. This is where
predictive analytics is being used to support decision-making, and not
to replace it. Providing automated information and decision support to
become productive, is increasingly becoming key driver in the insurance
market. Predictive analytics in text mining, and drunken driving /
drug-impaired driving in automobile accidents: Drug-impaired driving is
an increasingly difficult problem for insurers, law enforcement
officers, prosecutors, judges, and policy makers. There are three
reasons for identifying drugimpaired driving for drivers involved in an
automobile accident in the interest of motor insurance stakeholders. i.</p>
<p>First reason relates to ‗claim recovery&rsquo;. It is necessary to know that
the driver might have been under the influence of a</p>
<p>(a) Medication, (b) Prescription, (c) Drug, or (d) Has consumed
illegal narcotics This will help the insurer assign a specialist who is
able to efficiently determine whether a drug-impaired condition existed
at the time of the accident. Generally determining whether a driver was
driving under the influence of a drug is much more complicated than
determining whether a driver was under the influence of alcohol.
Furthermore, it is also necessary to know whether the driver had been
taking a medication such as an overthe-counter product, prescription,
drug, or illegal narcotic. ii. Second reason relates to „assignment of
liability‟, and especially subrogation opportunities. Finding that the
other driver was under the influence of a medication may be a cause for
a subrogation recovery against that driver / owner, or provide enough
additional evidence to increase the likelihood or size of the recovery
in case individual liability is awarded. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>iii. Third reason relates to „non-renewal‟. If an insurer knows that
the driver had been involved in an accident while on a medication,
prescription, drug, or illegal narcotic, it may be a reason to not renew
the cover or to renew the cover at a higher rate. Information not
typically captured in insurer data systems is to be captured whether one
of the drivers in the accident was on a medication, prescription, drug,
or an illegal narcotic is extracted from the accident description. This
will improve the ability to predict the severity of an accident.
Narrative data can feed predictive analytics, improve claim-triage and
subrogation recovery opportunities, and empower a more intelligent
approach to renewals and rate-classification. With driving under the
influence of a drug representing a measurable though largely
unrecognised source of increased accident severity, automobile insurers
have an opportunity to extract value from text mining and better manage
the risk posed by driving under the influence of drugs. i.</p>
<p>Detection of driver under the influence of drug; driving while
intoxicated</p>
<p>Detecting drivers are under the influence of a drug is much more
complicated than detecting drivers who are driving under the influence
of alcohol i.e., driving while intoxicated. Alcohol passes through the
body in a reasonably predictable manner and has an impact on a driver&rsquo;s
ability to operate a vehicle safely. Field tests can be performed
efficiently for driving while intoxicated with acceptable accuracy.
Furthermore, it does not matter whether the blood alcohol content was
due to the intake of beer, wine, or hard alcohol; the sex, age, or body
mass of the individual; or the length of time since consumption. A blood
alcohol content of 0.08 grams per deciliter or higher is considered a
per se case of driving while intoxicated.</p>
<h2 id="ii-drug-impaired-driving">ii. Drug-impaired Driving</h2>
<p>By contrast, tests for medications and prescriptions are more difficult to
perform. It may take days, weeks, or months to obtain results. For the
impairment-impact of drugs on an individual&rsquo;s ability to operate a motor
vehicle, there is no corollary to a blood alcohol content standard.
Detecting drug-impaired driving is a complex problem due to the large
number of substances with the potential to impair driving and impose the
risk of an accident, the variations in the ways that different drugs can
impair driving, the lack of basic information concerning the drugs that
impair driving, and the differences in the ways that the drugs can
affect the body and behavior.</p>
<h2 id="iii-identifying-the-presence-of-drugs-in-auto-accidents">iii. Identifying the presence of drugs in auto accidents</h2>
<p>We need to increase the efforts to train law enforcement machinery to recognise
drivers that may be driving under the influence of drug. The typical
case is for an officer to perform &ldquo;standardised field sobriety test&rdquo; for
a driver&rsquo;s blood alcohol content. If the Blood Alcohol Content is found
to exceed the statutory limit, the officer is unlikely to test for
drugs, and consequently the incidence of driver under the influence of
drug may be understated. If the Blood Alcohol Content does not exceed
the statutory limit, the officer may seek evidence for a driver under
the influence of drug charge. Identifying drivers under the influence of
a drug is much more complicated than the testing for alcohol with a
&ldquo;breathalyzer or urine test&rdquo;. For drug impairment, the tests may require
a broader range of specimens (e.g., blood, urine, oral fluid, sweat, and
hair) and the present technology often requires lab tests that may take
longer time. This built-in delay and the variety of potential results
are bound to pose a challenge when it comes to accurately tracking
driver under the influence of drug instances, since the pertinent
information may not be available at the time of the accident or when the
police reports are prepared.</p>
<h2 id="iv-presence-of-drugs-in-automobile-accidents">iv. Presence of drugs in automobile accidents</h2>
<p>Insurers need to develop methods to efficiently read,
organise, and analyse large volumes of narrative data captured in
accident descriptions, survey reports, and other reports and documents
where narrative information is recorded in an unstructured text format.
Within a single narrative report and across reports, the same concept
(such as taking his medications) can be expressed in numerous ways. The
software has to be built developing methods to organise
different-butsimilar expressions into a format that can be categorised
and then included in statistical analyses. A database on automobile
accidents will have to compile information on broad representative third
party vehicular accidents. The accidents will include: (a) Single and
multiple vehicle incidents, (b) Drivers of various ages, (c) Accidents
occurring in a variety of environmental conditions (d) Compile a
narrative description of each accident, as well as the usual information
on number of vehicles, road conditions, weather conditions, and time of
day</p>
<p>(e) Describe the environmental conditions, vehicular movements, and
driver behaviour at the time of the accident (f) Processing the accident
descriptions: Narrative descriptions for the accidents may be broken
into phrases, and similar phrases can be grouped together using
analytical models. After removing prepositions and uninformative
prepositional phrases, the result is a data file with few million
phrases</p>
<h2 id="e-identification-of-the-surprise-claim">e) Identification of the Surprise Claim</h2>
<p>Insurers are also giving
importance to claims after the first-notice-of-loss. There is greater
emphasis for early identification of the surprise-claims. Nobody seems
to understand reasons for a claim that looks like it's going to be Rs.
30,000 or Rs. 40,000 and becomes a Rs. 2,00,000 or Rs. 3,00,000 claim.
Predictive models are applied not just at first-notice-of-loss or
preliminary report of injury, but during the claims process, to enable
them to much more rapidly identify and deal with them, because those are
the claims that need immediate attention to avoid unpleasantness later.</p>
<h2 id="f-predictive-analytics-for-commercial-lines-of-business">f) Predictive Analytics for Commercial Lines of Business</h2>
<p>Commercial insurance lines have lagged behind personal lines in adopting predictive
analytics because commercial lines tend more toward an underwriting
approach to pricing and risk management, assuming that the computer can
never replace the underwriter. But some commercial insurance companies
have begun to see that better science&mdash;the type of science that modern
predictive analytics can provide&mdash;can help underwriters do their jobs
more effectively. The underwriter&rsquo;s skill comes from centuries of the
industry&rsquo;s collective experience and years of the underwriter&rsquo;s personal
experience. Much of that skill derives from the underwriter&rsquo;s intuitive
feel for the task. Underwriters have formed a kind of knowledge center
for the insurance industry, but their skills and intuition can&rsquo;t always
be applied perfectly as markets change and more data becomes available
through third-party sources and other forms of data, such as telematics.
Given better information and allowing underwriters to focus on the
important risks, they will make better decisions. Just as many personal
line carriers have discovered, a number of small and midsize commercial
line insurers have adopted predictive analytics for scoring and pricing
a tool that extends underwriters&rsquo; capabilities and improves the accuracy
of their predictions. The same benefits are available to all commercial
carriers. Commercial lines data offers a tremendous predictive signal,
therefore companies are free to mine, if they are willing to embrace
state-of-the-art technology. 252</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>A large global carrier increased its commercial lines business
profitably by implementing a predictive analytics solution that provided
actionable insight based on a relatively low volume of commercial lines
data. Segmentation models showed that, of nearly $800 million in total
premium, 19 percent of the exposures were significantly underpriced and
34 percent significantly overpriced. Lowering the rates on its
overpriced business had a positive effect on the company&rsquo;s customer
retention, and raising the rates on its underpriced accounts quickly
improved its bottom line. The newly identified variables were introduced
into the rating algorithm for faster, more accurate rating going
forward. g) Pricing and Underwriting for Predictive Analytics Most
companies adopting predictive analytics think of it exclusively as a
tool to help them with their pricing and underwriting. That&rsquo;s an
excellent application, but it is only one of many possible ones.
Predictive analytics is also useful in the following, among other tasks:
i.</p>
<p>Customer acquisition</p>
<p>How and where to prospect for good business is key to customer
acquisition? Effective customer acquisition efforts can help companies
predict which prospects are likely to respond to a specific marketing
campaign. ii. Target marketing Where to find the right customers and how
to identify good customers for Target marketing? Optimal target
marketing efforts are broader than customer acquisition efforts and
focus on defining which prospects are likely to yield profitable
business. Is iii. Broker management To help company understand how their
agency or broker force is performing, and how much of their ―good
business‖ is being submitted to your company. iv. Cost reduction To
reduce costs, by making decisions on when to use outside data and when
not to use?</p>
<p>IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>v. Retention management To understand which of your company&rsquo;s clients
are most likely to leave and, in addition, which are likely to be
profitable and unprofitable vi. Claims process management To understand
which claims are likely to be fraudulent, which are likely to develop
into large claims, and other factors?</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>A small insurance Company wanted to see whether it would be cost
effective to eliminate motor vehicle records (MVR&rsquo;s) on a portion of its
book of business, enabling a reduction in both expenses and premium. The
company used predictive analytics to identify portions of the book where
the reduction of expenses would more than offset the lower premiums. The
exercise ran 10 years of data &mdash; more than 15 lakh Motor Vehicle
Records through a predictive analytics system and found that eliminating
MVRs on certain business would drive several crores more in profits
annually. Predictive analytics is not just a once-a-year exercise.
There&rsquo;s a tendency for Insurers to think that they can complete an
annual predictive analytics process, then fix their pricing or implement
other changes &mdash; and they will be set until next year. They&rsquo;re missing
the point, however, that they ought to be analysing the results
throughout the year, and changing and tweaking wherever they can. So if
a company carries out an analysis and incorporates the results in its
rate plan, the company&rsquo;s executives should use analytics to measure the
results throughout the distribution force and apply the results in
marketing throughout the year, leveraging the work already done on
pricing. In other words, the full benefit of a predictive analytics
approach is not just where a company can use it, but how often the
company can use it. h) More Predictive Signals Gained As we said
earlier, it&rsquo;s not a matter of how much data, or even how ―clean‖ your
data is; it&rsquo;s a matter of using the best available technology to analyse
the data, replacing traditional linear models with tool sets capable of
automatically identifying all relevant variables and analysing the
predictive power of interactions among them. If you believe you need to
find new data sources because you aren&rsquo;t getting sufficient results and
can&rsquo;t get anything more out of your data, you probably are not using the
best available technology.</p>
<p>When it comes to getting every insight out of the data, it also doesn&rsquo;t
matter how large or small you are. There are large global insurers with
access to sophisticated analytics tools that are not getting all of the
available insights out of their data. And there are mid-sized carriers
using machine-learning technology on relatively small data sets to
optimise their businesses.</p>
<p>Example A top auto insurance Company used a combination of traditional
predictive analytics methods, supplemented by more advanced modeling
techniques. Using this approach produced results in 18 months. The
Insurers analytics team thought they had extracted all predictive
signals possible. However, when machine-learning technology was applied
to the same data, the results were surprising. The results showed that
60 percent of the carrier&rsquo;s business was mispriced by more than 10
percent, up to 50 percent. And the machine learning method worked
significantly faster, producing results in only eight weeks. If one
wants optimal results, try using today&rsquo;s sophisticated tools, which take
advantage of machine-learning-based predictive analytics. All General
Insurance companies&rsquo; small and large, personal and commercial lines
insurers&rsquo; should use modern machine learning based predictive analytics,
not just for pricing and underwriting, but for applications that manage
the entire life cycle of the customer. It&rsquo;s easy to get started, and
it&rsquo;s not necessary to have an army of scientists on the payroll. It will
pay for itself quickly, and ultimately it will help your company survive
within an increasingly competitive market.</p>

<li>Need for and importance of statistics</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-insurance-helps-cover-cost-of-an-unforeseen-accident">a) Insurance helps cover cost of an unforeseen accident</h2>
<p>The motor vehicle is probably one of the most expensive items a person owns.
Insurance protects this asset and helps him in coping with the financial
loss caused by accidents, damage or theft. Another reason is that while
driving, a person is responsible for the safety of: i. Passengers i. .
Fellow drivers i. . Other people's property iv. Pedestrians, Road users
v. Insured Insurance helps cover the costs of potential damages or
injuries in case of an unforeseen accident or theft. Above all, in India
it is mandatory to have at least a Third Party Motor Insurance before
you can drive on the roads.</p>
<h2 id="b-competitive-nature-of-indian-motor-insurance-market">b) Competitive nature of Indian Motor Insurance Market</h2>
<p>Motor insurance market in India has entered a highly
competitive state. The presence of both private and public sector
insurers and the freedom to decide the premium rates makes it imperative
that the insurers follow sound underwriting techniques and charge
sustainable premiums. It is therefore essential for them to ensure the
information at their disposal is accurate and up to date for appropriate
decision making. This requires statistics of previous underwritten
risks.</p>
<h2 id="c-information-appropriate-for-underwriting-purposes">c) Information appropriate for underwriting purposes</h2>
<p>Information appropriate for underwriting purposes are:
i. Age of the vehicle,
i. . Condition of vehicle,
i. . Particulars of refurbished vehicles,
iv. Imported vehicles and v. Other information culled from the proposal
forms</p>
<h2 id="d-factor-for-rate-of-premium">d) Factor for rate of premium</h2>
<p>As rates of premium are based on past loss experience it is most essential to maintain a detailed statistical
structure for Motor Insurance. The rate of premium depends upon four
factors i. Claims cost, i . Commission, i i. Expenses and iv. Profit The
last three can be fairly estimated. But the claims cost is the unknown
component of the premium and has to be ascertained by statistical
methods. The erstwhile tariff provided for three main classifications of
vehicles and sub-classifications in each class (these classifications
continue to be followed at present). It follows that statistics of
premium and claims should also be maintained and collated on the same
basis. The nature of the cover provided is also relevant as different
rates are provided for Own Damage, and Act only covers. This factor
should be incorporated in the statistical structure.</p>
<h2 id="e-estimating-outstanding-claims">e) Estimating Outstanding Claims</h2>
<p>Interpretation of statistics is as important as collation. For example the claims cost reflect not only the paid claims
but also outstanding claims. But there is a long gap in settlement of
motor claims, especially third party claims. This delay would mean that
the true claims cost would be evident only after 3 to 4 years.
Therefore, it is essential that an effective system to place proper
estimates on outstanding claims be devised. Once the claims cost is
known, it is possible to develop incurred claims to premium ratio in
each classification to consider effecting appropriate underwriting
measures by the companies and rate revisions (upward or downwards) by
the them.</p>
<h2 id="f-prospective-loss-experience-by-suitable-adjustments">f) Prospective loss experience by suitable adjustments</h2>
<p>The results of past loss experience has to be interpreted in the light of
changing conditions surrounding motor insurance business. Some
adjustments will have to be made and the figure, to some extent,
projected into the future taking into account annual increase in the
number of vehicles, increase in population, changes in road
construction, changes in common or statutory law, trends of third party
awards, etc. In other words, past loss experience will have to be
converted into prospective loss experience by suitable adjustments.</p>
<h2 id="g-role-of-it-systems-in-calculating-premium-rates-on-real-time-basis">g) Role of IT systems in calculating premium rates on real-time basis</h2>
<p>The value of motor insurance statistics depends upon the correctness of
the figures and the speed with which they can be produced. The
collection, collating and interpreting of statistical data has been
considerably simplified with the Information Technology Revolution. The
IT platforms have made it possible to capture a large variety of
information and subject it to analysis. A few motor insurers in India
have been able to decide premium rates on ―real-time‖ basis i.e. their
systems are recording data of premium and claims on a continuous basis,
this in turn is assisting them in quoting premium rates for a particular
risk on immediate loss experience ratio.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-2">Test Yourself 2</h2>

<h2 id="c-tac-as-data-depository-and-tac-as-national-repository">C. TAC as Data Depository and TAC as National Repository</h2>
<ol>
<li>TAC as Data Depository</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>IRDA had earlier designated the TAC as the national
repository of the insurance statistical data on underwriting and claims
of all motor insurers. Insurers are required to capture all the relevant
data and forward to the TAC on a quarterly basis. In addition to the
data provided to the TAC, insurers are recording other information of
the vehicles insured by them to provide a competitive edge to their
acceptance of risks.</p>
<p>Example i. Some insurers record the colour of the vehicles in private
car insurance to ascertain which colour is more accident prone. This is
a common feature in the international market. i.</p>
<p>. The regular parking space of the vehicle is another feature noted.</p>
<p>The statistical data is very exhaustive. The TAC has devised a standard
format for submission of statistics by all insurers. These data are to
be submitted on a quarterly basis. The IRDA is monitoring the prompt
submission and penalising insurers who do not provide the details within
the timelines laid down. Standardised codes are laid down for the
majority of data required. As insurers may have their own requirements
and codes, they are permitted to use codes for their specific
requirements, in which case a Code master of such codes are to be sent
to the TAC along with the quarterly returns.</p>
<p>Example An example of such code maybe a sub-zone code adopted by the
insurer e.g. Commercial Vehicle Zone A Sub-zone 2 (Delhi-NCR) etc. The
TAC data requirement is under three major sets. Various alphanumeric
codes have been assigned to the data e.g., Vehicle makes code, Insurer
code etc. The requirement is of individual records. The data sets are i.
Underwriting Policy data i . Claims paid data ii. . Input data It may be
mentioned at this juncture that owing to the dilution of functions of
TAC in recent years, the IRDA has constituted the Insurance Information
Bureau (IIB) which has taken the place of TAC as data depository. Hence
reference to TAC may be read as reference to IIB. a) Underwriting Policy

<p>The data required is very comprehensive. It captures most of the details
available in the proposal. It is however identity neutral as it does not
require the name or address of the proposer. All possible additional
covers are also recorded individually as well as the discounts opted.
Underwriting Data Output: The macro data statistics that can be
generated are with regard to the motor portfolio distribution among all
insurers; the classes and sub-classes of vehicles and their distribution
across the national zones and premium quantum distribution across all
classes of vehicles and the nature and extent of the additional coverage
of various risks.</p>

obtained on the losses. It is a first step in the systematic recording
of nature and types of losses. At the macro level it provides a picture
of the extent of losses faced by insurers across all categories of
vehicles and sub-classes.</p>
<h2 id="c-input-data">c) Input Data</h2>
<p>Insurers&rsquo; records are now created, recorded and stored on a computerised system. The information
for underwriting has to be accurate and complete to generate the policy
document, and accounting links. Most of the underwriting information
generated is in terms of the TAC requirement. There will be a few
deviations to incorporate the additional underwriting features that the
respective insurer consider relevant and essential for their
underwriting practice and their record inputs will provide for this.
Underwriting Input Data: The particulars of every risk accepted by the
insurers are obtained and can be grouped as under Vehicle particulars
The class &amp; sub-class of the vehicle e.g. private car or taxi; private
or public use  Area of operation &amp;/or zone of registration  The make,
model, year, engine &amp; chassis No, carrying capacity.  The colour of the
vehicle and its mileage readings.  Additional fittings installed

of owner, others regularly driving the vehicle and regular employed
driver.  Coverage- the insurance coverage taken with all add-ons and
deductions. Each field is captured separately.  Value of the vehicle
and all additional fittings, individually  Premium charged and
discounts allowed.  With the underwriting data computerized the claims
process has also to be linked. The claims process too has been
computerized from the time of intimation of the loss to its settlement
all are recorded and tracked. This monitoring has speeded up the claim
settlement process.</p>

<h2 id="d-output-data">d) Output Data</h2>
<p>The collating and processing of the above data provides a platform for
the insurer to take appropriate decisions on motor insurance. The
underwriting and claims data provide a number of useful MIS for insurers</p>
<ol start="2">

</ol>

<h2 id="a-underwriting-output">a) Underwriting Output</h2>
<h2 id="iloss-ratios-for-different-classes-and-subclasses-of-motor-vehicles">i.Loss ratios for different classes and subclasses of motor vehicles</h2>
<p>It can be used to compare with the data for the individual insurer to
ascertain the deviation from national average - positive or negative.
This will provide the insurers with the appropriate base premium to be
charged for the classes. The underwriting response to adverse ratio can
then be worked upon</p>
<h2 id="ii-loss-ratio-for-different-makes-and-models-of-vehicles">ii. Loss ratio for different makes and models of vehicles</h2>
<p>A comparison of these ratios can highlight the more loss prone
vehicles and measures to counteract them. The output on claims break-up
between OD &amp; TP claims across the various classes individually &amp;
collectively. Adverse OD claims can result in follow-up action, in the
form of loading of premium or applying specific terms or restrictions.
The statistical data output on age of vehicles and the loss ratios
thereon can generate appropriate responses for acceptance of risks and
the terms thereof. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>Distribution of vehicles across RTA zones can assist in deciding targets
for development of business or shrinking of market based on loss ratios.</p>
<h2 id="b-claims-output">b) Claims Output</h2>
<p>The claims reports generated from the data are normally
expressed in the following forms</p>
<p>i. Claims paid in absolute terms
against premium class wise. This statement will give an overall picture
of the profitability or otherwise of the motor portfolio of insurers
across class wise i.</p>
<p>. Distribution of premium and claims coverage - wise and class-wise.
This is snapshot of the distribution of premium and claims for OD &amp; TP.
It is still on absolute terms but gives a truer picture of the
underwriting practice of companies. OD premiums are within control of
insurers; hence high claims here reflect poor underwriting or unexpected
catastrophic events for the year.</p>
<p>i.. Incurred claims ratios are a truer picture of the business as they
adjust for previous years losses. Claims paid in the period and
outstanding at the end of the period less outstanding at the start of
the period. Here too the statistics can be generated on consolidated
basis or break-up as to coverage and even age &amp; vehicle category basis.
It cannot be more emphasised that an accurate and comprehensive data
collections is essential for generating outputs that would be valuable
to an insurer in deciding the risks to accept and the appropriate terms
to ensure a profitable portfolio in a competitive environment.</p>
<h2 id="c-other-outputs">c) Other Outputs</h2>
<p>There is a strong perception among insurers that TP
premiums are unviable. However they have been unable to raise the rates
due to the absence of clear and authentic data. Thus one of the major
benefits in generation of and maintenance of data by an independent
central repository will assist in proving this perception and provide an
opportunity in raising the premium rates. i. The statistical data on
record can generate many other outputs e.g. distribution of survey work
among surveyors or advocates in case of motor TP i.</p>
<p>. Analysis of data on TP claims across various courts could help in more
accurate provisioning of outstanding claims filed in various courts.
E.g. There is a general belief that courts in some states are more
liberal in awarding compensation to applicants. The detailed statistical
data can over a period support or refute such belief.</p>
<p>. They can even provide details of quantum of claims paid to various
repairers, the nature of damage and extent could decide whether the
payments are reasonable or exorbitant.</p>
<p>iv. The data could also provide trends on claims settlements for
various types of loss or damage for corrective action to be taken, where
necessary Information technology&rsquo;s benefits are only as good as the raw
information supplied. It therefore requires a strong commitment and
interest from the top management of organisations to ensure that the
need for and importance of accurate raw data and the outcome&rsquo;s benefits
are brought to the notice of all concerned. In a de-tariff environment
the availability of statistical data to determine prices and
profitability is of great importance. It is therefore essential that
such information is available quickly and comprehensively. Thus a
wellplanned and comprehensive information technology platform must be
the goal of every insurer.</p>

Usefulness or iv. Simply for pure innovation Many new car technologies
are either specifically built for safety or at least have some sort of
safety focus to them. Some of it will help keep us safe, some will give

today -- electric ignition, automatic front &amp; rear windshield wipers,
power steering, airbags, cruise control and many more -- began life as
unexpected advances that dazzled the public.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>When GM introduced the first automatic transmission -- its
Hydra-Matic Drive -in the 1940 Oldsmobile, it was an expensive option
and more of a curiosity than a &quot;got -to-have&quot; feature. Today automatic
transmissions have advanced to the point of providing as many as eight
forward gears, driver-shift options, computerised driver-adaptable
shifting and different shifting modes, such as &quot;sport,&quot; &quot;touring&quot;
and &quot;snow.&quot; But in 1940, not stirring the transmission yourself was a
radical concept and only well-heeled risk takers pointed up the extra
cash for the new technology. Today's &quot;cutting edge&quot; is tomorrow's
&quot;commonplace.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="a-fully-autonomous-vehicles">a) Fully Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
<p>Also known as driverless
cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car),
and are expected to be commercially available around 2020. According to
urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric
vehicles in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for
work, travel, and pleasure could reduce the world's 800 million
vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades. This would
be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not
in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public
self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. i. This would
also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need a
bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a
special night out, and a Saffari could come for a short trip down the
street for one person.
i. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety.</p>
<p>i.. Driving under the influence of intoxication (DUIs) would no longer
exist, and few hundred thousand lives could be saved each year.</p>
<h2 id="b-v2v-vehicle-to-vehicle-automobile-technology">b) V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) Automobile Technology</h2>
<p>V2V is an automobile
technology designed to allow automobiles to ―talk‖ to each other. V2I is
an extension of V2V and allows vehicles to communicate with the roadside
infrastructure. Collectively they are known as V2V2I or V2X. The
V2X-connected vehicles vision is extensive and has the following goals:
i.</p>
<p>All vehicles have communication equipment that allows continuous
connection to all nearby vehicles.</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. All vehicles have communication equipment continuousconnection to all
roadways infrastructures.</p>
<p>. Many V2X applications to improve safety, traffic flow, energy usage
and others will be developed. Many yet unforeseen V2X applications are
likely to emerge.</p>
<p>iv. V2X will become an enabling technology for future cruise-assisted
highways and autonomous driving. v. The deployment timing of this vision
is uncertain, but deployment will probably start between 2015 and 2020
in Europe and the US. Japan has already started to deploy V2I- based
systems. V2V is expected to be significant by 2020 and will become
prevalent by 2025. The IHS Automotive topical report, V2X Technology's
Arrival Key to Accident Reduction and Prevention, looks at the current
status of the V2X market with reviews of key US, Japan and European
Union projects. V2X application, business models and deployment options
are also explored. The market potential of V2V is projected based on
three forecast scenarios conservative, expected and aggressive forecasts
are included in a spreadsheet model, which has details on four regions:
United States, Western Europe, Japan and worldwide. The V2X
Technology's Arrival ―Key to Accident Reduction and Prevention‖ report
is available on IHS Automotive Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS)
Portal. The portal, powered by IHS iSuppli, allows users to quickly
assess potential market demand and attach rates for key ADAS and safety
systems used in the production of light vehicles. The portal includes
profiles of all production vehicles around the world, as well as
industry news, technology reports, supplier profiles, OEM-supplier
relationships, regulation and mandate details and industry forecasts
segmented by application and geographic region. c) Alternatives to the
Automobile Established alternatives for some aspects of automobile use
include public transit such as i.</p>
<p>Buses,</p>
<p>i . Trolleybuses, i i. Trains, iv. Subways, v. Tramways light rail, vi.
Cycling, and</p>
<p>IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>vi . Walking Car-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly
popular &ndash; the US market leader in car-sharing has experienced
double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and
2007, offering a service that enables urban residents to &quot;share&quot; a
vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighborhoods.
Bike-share systems have been tried in some European cities, including
Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programs have been experimented with
in a number of US Cities. Additional individual modes of transport, such
as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to automobiles
if they prove to be socially accepted.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-3">Test Yourself 3</h2>
<p>The TAC data requirement is under three major sets. The
requirement is of individual records. The data sets are: I. Underwriting
policy data, Claims paid data and Input data II. Underwriting policy
data, Premium collected data and Input data III. Underwriting policy
data, Premium collected data and Output data IV. Policy issued data,
Premium collected data and Output data</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>a) With regards to role of IT systems in the growth of the
insurance industry, success in the insurance industry is expected to
come from two areas: Cloud systems and analytics. b) Analytics is the
discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data, especially
valuable in areas rich with recorded information. c) Analytics is a
two-sided coin: i.</p>
<p>On one side, it uses descriptive and predictive models to gain valuable
knowledge from data - data analysis. i . On the other, analytics uses
this insight to recommend action or to guide decision making -
communication. d) The auto manufacturers are providing connected vehicle
services to discerning customers. This includes: GPS, Emergency
notification, Roadside assistance, Concierge services and other
offerings. e) With regards to IT interventions and Data Analytics in
insurance industry, the key areas are: enterprise intelligence, enhanced
analytics, predictive analytics, data governance and data security. f)
Insurers have so far identified Analytics, Business intelligence, Data
warehousing and Big data to help them make better use of the data they
have, access newly available data and make better, more informed
decisions to find opportunities, price them more effectively and reduce
losses. g) IRDAI has set up a subsidiary Insurance Information Bureau of
India (IIB) for collating data from the industry and then analysing them
h) Predictive analytics is not just for fraud management in insurance
industry anymore, but the same can extend into other areas of Claims
Management such as Surveyors and Loss Adjusters assignment,
Loss-adjustment expense and Decision-support i) There are three reasons
for identifying drug-impaired driving for drivers involved in an
automobile accident in the interest of motor insurance stakeholders: i.
i. i.</p>
<p>First reason relates to ‗claim recovery&rsquo;. . Second reason relates to
‗assignment of liability&rsquo;, and especially subrogation opportunities. .
Third reason relates to ‗non-renewal'.</p>
<p>j) A blood alcohol content of 0.08 grams per deciliter or higher is
considered a per se case of driving while intoxicated. 269</p>
<p>k) Predictive models are applied not just at first-notice-of-loss or
preliminary report of injury, but during the claims process, to enable
them to much more rapidly identify and deal with them, because those are
the claims that need immediate attention to avoid unpleasantness later.
l) Some commercial insurance companies have begun to see that better
science&mdash;the type of science that modern predictive analytics can
provide&mdash; can help underwriters do their jobs more effectively. m) Most
companies adopting predictive analytics think of it exclusively as a
tool to help them with their pricing and underwriting. n) Predictive
analytics is also useful in the following, among other tasks: Customer
acquisition, Target marketing, Broker management, Cost reduction,
Retention management, Claims process management. o) Factor for rate of
premium: The rate of premium depends upon four factors: Claims cost,
commission, expenses and profit p) A few motor insurers in India have
been able to decide premium rates on ―real-time‖ basis i.e. their
systems are recording data of premium and claims on a continuous basis,
this in turn is assisting them in quoting premium rates for a particular
risk on immediate loss experience ratio. q) Insurers are required to
capture all the relevant data and forward to the TAC on a quarterly
basis. r) The TAC data requirement is under three major sets. The
requirement is of individual records. The data sets are: Underwriting
policy data, Claims paid data, Input data s) Underwriting Data Input:
The data required is very comprehensive. It captures most of the details
available in the proposal. t) Underwriting Data Output: The macro data
statistics that can be generated are with regard to the motor portfolio
distribution among all insurers. The classes and sub-classes of vehicles
and their distribution across the national zones. Premium quantum
distribution across all classes of vehicles and the nature and extent of
the additional coverage of various risks. u) Claims Data Input: The
claims data requirement sets out to capture a detailed picture of the
types, nature and quantum of claims paid separately for OD and TP. v)
Underwriting Input Data: The particulars of every risk accepted by the
insurers are obtained and can be grouped as under: Vehicle particulars
and Claims Input Data</p>
<p>w) Claims Output: The claims reports generated from the data are
normally expressed in the following forms: i. i. i.</p>
<p>Claims paid in absolute terms against premium class wise. . Distribution
of premium and claims coverage - wise and class-wise. . Incurred claims
ratios are a truer picture of the business as they adjust for previous
years losses.</p>
