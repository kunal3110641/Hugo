<p>International Legal Scenario: Germany, England, France, Australia, South Africa, USA</p>
<ol>
<li>Germany</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Motor Third Party insurance in Germany is based on the German
Road Traffic Acts. The motor insurance liability is based on Tort i.e.,
negligence of the driver of the vehicle is required to be proved to
claim compensation. Insurance is compulsory. The law specifies limits
for death or injury and property damage. It allows for payment of lump
sum or annuity or step by step throughout the life of the claimant. It
is the practice to pay annuity in the case of minors and severely
injured persons who may be unable to manage their finances e.g. due to
brain injury. The limits of liability presently prevalent are as
follows: Death or injury Death or injury of several people from same
occurrence Property damage</p>
<p>Maximum Lumpsum Maximum Annuity Maximum Lumpsum Maximum Annuity</p>
<p>Euro 600,000 Euro 30,000 pa Euro 3,000,000 Euro 180,000 pa Euro
1,000,000</p>
<h2 id="2-england">2. England</h2>
<p>Motor insurance in India has followed the practice of Motor
insurance in England The difference in practice in England presently is
with regard to the formation of a Motor Insurance Bureau (MIB)
comprising most insurers offering motor insurance, although Lloyds
underwriters are not its member but they usually follow similar
practices with regard to TP Liability. i.</p>
<p>Liability for injuries to third party is unlimited.</p>
<p>i . Property damage is STR. 1,000,000/-. However, insurers provide wider
property damage cover. The Motor Insurance Bureau takes on
responsibility to compensate Third Parties for motor accidents involving
vehicles that are uninsured, or untraced. This is possible as they
maintain a fund contributed by all the members. This is similar to our
system of Solatium Fund for Hit &amp; Run cases. The MIB goes further by
paying for compensation where the vehicle is uninsured i.e. identified
with no insurance</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>France</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Motor Third Party liability in France is a
legal obligation based on strict liability. Insurance and is compulsory.
Liability for injuries is unlimited whereas property damage is limited.
Contributory negligence is applied only in the case of driver claims.
Thus third parties get claims irrespective of contributory negligence.
300</p>
<p>Unidentified and uninsured vehicles victims&rsquo; are compensated from the
Guarantee Fund (Fonds de Garantie). Compensation may be in lump sum or
annuity for severely injured persons or minors. Compensation settlement
offers must be made within the stipulated time frame otherwise the
interest rate payable on compensation amounts is doubled.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Australia</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Third Party personal injury is compulsory in Australia but the practice
of insurance differs among the States. The fund and payout for such
liability is maintained by the States of South Australia and Victoria.
The cost is included in the licence registration fees or vehicle
registration fees. New South Wales and Queensland require insurance
through the state specified insurers. The Queensland government controls
the price for the cover. Property damage is not compulsory and may be
insured with the OD insurance.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>South Africa</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Personal injury liability
is paid by the state In South Africa. A percentage on the price of motor
fuel is allocated for this fund.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>USA</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Motor Third party insurance
practice differs among the states of the USA. It may also differ based
on the category of vehicle e.g. personal, commercial etc. The term is
called ‗financial responsibility liability&rsquo;. Each state has different
minimum limits required but these are not binding and claimants can sue
for tort liability which can be substantial. The Department of Motor
Vehicles (DMV) ensures minimum liability coverage is in place. This
coverage may be in the form of: i. Cash deposit with the authority i .
Surety bond from licenced surety providers i i. Self-insurance iv.
Insurance through licenced insurers within the state Proof of such
coverage being in place, has to be provided to the Department of Motor
Vehicles. Failure to do so could result in cancellation of the
registration or impounding of vehicle or fines or imprisonment. The
compensation limits would be in the following manner: i. Injury to one
person i . Injury to more than one person from one occurrence i i.
Property damage</p>
<p>Texas: This would be written as 25 / 50 / 25 which translated is US$
25000 / 50000 / 25000 for each of the above heads. These limits apply in
the state of Texas. Alaska: In Alaska it is 50 / 100 / 25 or California
15 / 30 / 5. New York: New York has different limits for injury and
death for one or more than one thus 25/50//50/100//10. The practice is
for owners to take additional covers to the extent they can afford to
cover tort liability.</p>

<h2 id="b-third-party-claims-management-in-india">B. Third Party Claims Management in India</h2>
<p>Third Party Claims Management
occupies a very vital cog in the wheel of an insurer. It forms a major
component of the portfolio of any insurer. From Ambassador to Nano,
India has come a long way in the development of automobile sector. India
is now the 11th largest producer of motor vehicles The basic insurance
concepts and general principles change contextually, in relation to
compulsory motor insurance. General principles per se may be the bedrock
or foundation of insurance, but they have to be and must be tailored for
understanding and appreciating the construction of the applicability of
such general principles in the light of statutory nature of the contract
of motor insurance and benevolent intention of the Parliament,
reflecting the will of the people, to provide succor and relief to the
innocent victims of rising tide of motor accidents what with the
exploding vehicle population and alarmingly slow quality growth of the
infrastructure component vis-a-vis the road network, poor traffic laws
compliance in India. That is the purport of Third Party Claims
management, to drive home the truths and be told as they are.</p>
<h2 id="1-statutory-liability-in-motor-portfolio">1. Statutory Liability in Motor Portfolio</h2>
<p>Motor insurance is different
specie altogether in the context of contract of Insurance and the Third
Party liability insurance. It is premised on the fact that motor
insurance is compulsory vide Section 146 MV Act, 1988 (erstwhile Section
94 of MV Act, 1939). In view of the statutory nature of the said
liability, the Courts tend to come to the rescue of the victims. In
[(Skandia Insurance Claim) 1987 ACJ 411] the Supreme Court after
adverting to [(Captain Itbar Singh) 195865 ACJ 1 (SC)] made it clear
that the purpose of a contract of motor insurance was to provide
protection to the community of unsuspecting motor accidents victims.</p>
<h2 id="a-general-insurers-file-pil-to-tackle-uninsured-vehicles-issue">a) General insurers file PIL to tackle uninsured vehicles issue</h2>
<p>General insurance companies have filed public interest litigation in the Supreme
Court to get a direction to strictly enforce the provisions of the Motor
Vehicle Act, which make it a criminal offense to ply a vehicle without
insurance. Despite the fact that third party motor insurance is mandated
by law, general insurance companies have found that there are large
numbers of uninsured vehicles which continue to ply on the roads.</p>
<h2 id="ponder-over-this">Ponder over this</h2>
<p>A report by ICICI Lombard General Insurance said the
number of uninsured vehicles is estimated in the range of 40 per cent in
the case of cars and 70 per cent in the two-wheeler segment. According
to General Insurance Council of India, ―it is the responsibility of the
police and the Regional Transport Office to ensure that there are no
uninsured vehicles plying on roads. However, strict implementation of
this is a challenge.‖ Third party motor insurance is a bleeding
portfolio for general insurers with high claims ratio in excess of 120
per cent in recent times. It was not intended for the insurer to obtain
motor insurance premium and run their business on commercial lines.
Hence, it needs to be primarily understood and kept in mind that the
construction of a Motor Insurance Policy viz. a Third Party liability
would be diametrically different from the construction of the same
contract in relation to an own damage liability. This distinction need
be kept in mind while understanding the verdicts of the courts and
pursuing further litigation in relation to awards of Motor Accident
Claims Tribunals. General principles applicable to Motor Third Party
Liability insurance are discussed below.</p>
<h2 id="2-modification-in-doctrine-of-uberrimae-fides">2. Modification in Doctrine of Uberrimae Fides</h2>
<p>It is important to note
that compulsory third party insurance has introduced a modification in
the doctrine of utmost good faith. Notwithstanding, the insurers
entitlement to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the
policy, the insurer is mandated by law to pay to the third party, the
award decreed plus the costs and interest awarded, as if the insurer
were the judgment debtor. Insurers&rsquo; right to defend in this context is
also restricted to specific conditions under Section 149(2). The
principle of utmost good faith has been modified by Indian legislature
to this extent.</p>
<h2 id="a-judgment-debtor">a) Judgment Debtor</h2>
<p>The contract of Motor Insurance
permits the insurer to avoid its liability in various circumstances
e.g., i.</p>
<p>Dishonour of premium cheque,</p>
<p>i . Post-accident insurance, ii. . The vehicle in question remaining
unidentified though it is covered in a fleet, iv. Driving licence of the
driver is not found effective, and valid, v. Vehicle is used for the
purpose other than the purpose insured for, etc. If these circumstances
do not fall within the purview of Section 149 (2) of 1988 Act, the
insurer cannot invoke defence and escape liability awarded against the
insured. The terms of contract between insurer and insured, which
determine their inter se rights and liabilities, are different from
statutory liability of the insurer for the third party risk. If a
Certificate of Insurance has been issued complying with statutory
insurance provisions of the 1988 Act, Judgement in respect of compulsory
third party liability will be awarded against Insurance Company even
though the insurer is entitled to avoid the Policy.</p>
<h2 id="b-benevolent-legislation">b) Benevolent legislation</h2>
<p>It is a benevolent legislation as far as compensation is
payable towards third party liability. The insurer has to pay to the
third party, the amount decreed including cost and interest awarded, as
if the insurer was the judgment debtor, subject to the statutory limit
of property damage and / or unlimited liability in case of death or
disability.</p>
<h2 id="c-deep-pocket-theory">c) Deep Pocket Theory</h2>
<p>An insurer is required to pay to Third Parties,
even though he may be entitled to avoid or cancel the policy or may have
avoided or cancelled the policy. The proviso is an offshoot of deep
pocket theory, which requires a capable person to bear. The remedy
available to the insurer is to proceed against the insured for breach of
contract and to recover the amount so paid to satisfy award under the
provision of the Act, 1988. The insurer is, however, not liable to pay,
where the insurer cannot be fastened statutory liability under the
provisions of 1988 Act as given in Chapter X, XI &amp; XII read with the
Central Motor vehicle Rules 1989. The contract between the insurer and
the insured may permit the insurer to avoid his liability under various
circumstances. However, if these circumstances do not fall within the
purview of Section 149 (2) of Act 1988, the insurer cannot invoke them
in its aid and escape statutory liability towards the third party risk.
The terms of the contract between the insurer and the insured, which
determine their „inter se‟ rights and liabilities are different from
statutory liability of the insurer for the third party risk. The remedy
available to the insurer is to proceed against the insured for the
breach of the insurance contract and to claim reimbursement of the
amount paid to satisfy the award. However, if the insurer is not
statutorily liable e.g., liability of passengers carried in Goods
Carriage Vehicle, save as provided in the Act 2007, insurer is under no
obligation to pay to third party.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Insurable Interest</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Motor vehicle is
a property owned by a legal person who is exposed to loss or damage,
including liability towards third party caused by negligent use of the
vehicle in public place. This infers that extent of ownership interest
in a motor vehicle and its continued existence enables the owner or
other users, to use the vehicle with owner&rsquo;s knowledge and permission.
Motor vehicles are insured against third party liability and other
liability under the statutory provisions of Motor Vehicle Act 1988. It
would not be correct to argue that as long as the damage to the vehicle
is not covered, there is no insurable interest. The owner insured may
authorise other persons to drive his vehicle. Such users have strictly
speaking no insurable interest in any third party liability, but owner
is deemed to act as an agent in arranging the indemnity on behalf of
such other persons who may drive the vehicle, and the owner incurs legal
liability for the use of vehicle in public place. If that is not so, the
injured third parties will have no recourse to recover damages.</p>
<h2 id="a-under-mv-act-1988">a) Under MV Act 1988</h2>
<p>The statutory nature of the contract of insurance
is always kept in mind while dealing with the Third Party claims. That
it is meant to come to the rescue of the innocent motor accidents
victims, is never lost sight of. Parliament had mandated Section 157 of
MV Act, 1988 granting compulsory transfer of benefits of a contract of
insurer in favour of the purchaser of the vehicle. It is generally
understood that the person seeking insurance must have a legal right to
insure the subject matter of insurance. Therefore, insurers insist on
the Registration Certificate of the vehicle being in the name of the
insured, at the time of availing cover. But as per Section 146 Motor
Insurance cover is compulsory, and it is a settled law that any user of
the road is required to ensure, that there was a valid policy in force
at all times. It is equally well accepted that such insurable interest
need not flow from ownership or registration of the vehicle alone.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>In [1991 ACJ 625] the Madras High Court ruled that it did not
matter whether the Registration Certificate was in the name of A and the
policy of insurance in the name of B, so long, as there was a cover
existing as on date of accident. Hence, insurable interest and General
Regulation 32 of the All India Motor Tariff have to be understood
contextually. That is, in case insurers had issued the insurance policy,
without ensuring that the Registration Certificate was in the name of
the insured, they cannot later on suggest that the contract of insurance
was not enforceable or it was not valid as far as Third party liability
is concerned. The contract of insurance, even if issued, contrary to GR
32, would be valid and enforceable, as insurable interest in the context
of statutory motor insurance is not premised on ownership and
registration alone. More importantly, it needs to be understood that the
sale of a motor vehicle, come under Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and not
under MV Act, 1988. So, even if the Motor Vehicle was not transferred in
the name of purchaser, the purchaser would still be the legal / defacto
/ de jure owner as on the date of purchase, as held by the Supreme court
in [1980 ACJ 233] itself, which is good and binding law.</p>
<h2 id="b-should-the-industry-device-a-drivers-liability-cover-separately">b) Should the industry device a driver‟s liability cover separately?</h2>
<p>A moot question is, whether the indemnity so arranged on behalf of other
person e.g. a friend driving, whether creates any obligation to
reimburse the vehicle owner? Should we not think of introducing concept
of ―Driver&rsquo;s liability‖ in addition to the ‗Act liability&rsquo; to protect
the legal right of the vehicle owner, who is not obligated to pay on
behalf of a third person and the third party is entitled to
compensation, if there was no insurance available on vehicle or the
insurance cover has expired. The question, therefore, is whether injured
third parties have any recourse to recover damages?</p>
<p>i. Where a vehicle has no insurance?</p>
<p>Where vehicle is driven without owner&rsquo;s permission? Indian insurance
industry must take initiative to make available a separate cover for
such drivers who are using other person&rsquo;s vehicle. The owner cannot be
held liable, where the vehicle has been stolen or is used unauthorisedly
by another person for the acts committed by that other person.</p>
<h2 id="4principle-of-subrogation">4.Principle of Subrogation</h2>
<p>Definition Subrogation is the transfer of legal rights of an insured
against third party, to the insurer, when the loss or damage to the
vehicle is caused by the negligence of any other person. Insurer steps
into the shoes of insured&rsquo;s rights, remedies and options following
settlement of a claim under the policy and the insurer may also exercise
administrative control over claims, suits and other proceedings
accordingly in the name of the insured. Under common law, subrogation
operates after the claim is paid. In case of insurance of motor vehicle,
loss or damage to a stationary vehicle whilst parked may be caused by
another vehicle and the owner / insurer of the offending vehicle will
become liable. Subrogation usually arises when there is collision among
two vehicles, one of, which is to be blamed for the accident. Recovery
of loss from the owner of the offending vehicle, involves issues such as
negligence and the same will have to be determined and liability is to
be properly established by the courts, for recovering the loss.</p>
<p>However, insurers do not acquire any better title of interest than what
the insured possessed at the time of accident, and if insured has no
right of action, the insurers too in turn do not acquire any rights. As
the insurer steps into the shoes of the insured to enforce the principle
of subrogation, the right of recovery of Insurer from the third parties
is limited to the amount of claim settled and any excess amount so
recovered, will have to be passed on to the insured / owner of the
vehicle. This also infers that the insured is barred from making any
admission himself or compromising the amount of recovery from third
parties, after the insurers have settled his claim. However, in
practice, subrogation has been modified by Knock for Knock agreement
between insurers in case of liability arising out of physical damage to
vehicles involved and respective insurers meet full liability of
vehicles insured by them. 5. Non-applicability of Principle of
Contribution to Third Party Liability The Principle of Contribution does
not apply to third party liability for death or bodily injuries arising
out of the use of the motor vehicle and the Courts do not entertain any
plea from the insurer seeking ratable contribution for this liability
under their policy. Section II of the Motor Policy dealing with
liability to third parties stipulates that in terms of and subject to
the limitations of the indemnity, the insurer will indemnify any driver
who is driving the motor car on the insured&rsquo;s order or with his
permission, provided that such driver is not entitled to indemnity under
any other policy In commenting upon the ratable proportion clause
appearing in the policy, Mr. Raoul Colinvaux in his book, „The Law of
Insurance‟, discusses the rights of the insured / driver vis-a-vis the
insurer as hereunder: The burden of proving that the assured is entitled
to call upon the other insurer to pay in the event of a loss lies upon
the insurer who is praying the clause in his aid. If both policies are
legally binding covering risks, they will become enforceable and
contribute a ratable proportion of the loss. The contribution condition
need be specially worded in Private Car Policies to cover the owner of
the motor vehicle for third party liability while driving cars not
belonging to him so that the liability of such drivers is contributed by
them.</p>
<h2 id="6-doctrine-of-causa-proxima">6. Doctrine of Causa Proxima</h2>
<p>The application of the doctrine of causa
proxima or rule of proximate cause is equally important. The definition
of the rule of proximate cause was laid down in Pawsey vs. Scottish
Union as hereunder:</p>
<p>Definition Proximate cause is an active and efficient cause that sets in
motion a train of events, which brings about a result without the
intervention of any force started and working actively from a new and
independent source. The maxim ‗causa proxima non remota spectaur'
meaning that the proximate and not the remote cause is the factor to be
taken into account. The aforesaid loss is the loss against which the
motor vehicle is insured under the policy. Loss or damage to a motor
vehicle may be occasioned by one cause or a combination of causes.</p>
<p>Example A stationary vehicle may be hit by another vehicle in running
condition from the rear end, the stationary vehicle may injure persons
or damage property, but in deciding the cause of claim or admissibility
of the claim, the principle to be looked into is what the direct or
dominant cause of loss is?</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Necessity for Third Party Insurance</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Important Section 146 of the of 1988 Act provides that no person shall
use (except as a passenger), or allow any other person to use, a motor
vehicle in a public place, unless the vehicle is covered by a policy of
insurance complying with the requirements of the current MV Act 1988.
Section 146 is amended (by Amendment Act 1994) to cast an additional
duty that the owner of the vehicle carrying dangerous or hazardous goods
shall also go in for a policy of insurance under the ―Public Liability
Insurance Act, 1991‖. ―Public place‖ whether a thoroughfare or not, to
which the public have a right of access and includes any place or stand
at which passengers are picked up or set down by a stage carriage‖. (See
Para 8(p) for definition,)</p>
<p>It is not merely driving of the vehicle without insurance to contravene
the Act 1988. The sheer presence of motor-vehicle in stationery
condition, in public place will also constitute the ‗use&rsquo; of vehicle.
Secondly, the ‗use&rsquo; should be made in a ‗Public place'.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Any place or stand at which passengers are picked up or set
down by a stage carriage is a ―public place‖. The law is not so much
concerned with the ‗ownership of the place&rsquo; as with its ‗use or user&rsquo;.
Ownership of place may be private, but if use is by public, it is a
public place. However, a person driving a motor vehicle merely as a paid
employee will not be treated as contravening the Act 1988 if he has no
knowledge that there is no policy in force. Section 146 seeks to protect
members of public using public places from the risks of accidents caused
by the ‗user&rsquo; of motor vehicles. &ldquo;The motor vehicle can be likened to a
wild animal; whosoever keeps it, does so at his risk&rdquo;. A Court can only
pass an award or decree. It cannot ensure that such an award or decree
results in actual payment, because the person held liable may be
insolvent or may not have sufficient resources to meet the award. To
overcome the situation, the law has made it obligatory that no motor
vehicle shall be used unless third party insurance is in place. The law
also provides that the judgement obtained shall not be defeated by the
incorporation of exclusion clauses in the Policy other than those
authorised by Section 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.</p>
<p>Important All motor policies, therefore, contain a clause called
&ldquo;Avoidance of certain terms and right of recovery&rdquo; reading as under:
Nothing in this policy or any endorsement hereon shall affect the right
of any person to recover an amount under or by virtue of the provision
of the Motor Vehicles Act. But the insured shall repay to the Company
all sums paid by the Company, which the Company would not have been
liable to pay but for the said provisions.</p>
<h2 id="8-exemptions">8. Exemptions</h2>
<p>The provisions relating to compulsory third party
insurance do not apply to any vehicle owned by the Central Government or
a State Government and used for Government purposes unconnected with any
commercial enterprise. Exemption may also be granted by the appropriate
Government for any vehicle owned by: i. The Central Government or a
State Government, if the vehicle is used for Government purposes
connected with any commercial enterprise: i.. Any local authority;</p>
<p>i.. Any State Transport undertaking, (for example, where such undertaking
is carried on by a State Government or any Road Transport Corporation
established under the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950).</p>
<p>However, the above exemption is made only if a fund is established and
maintained by that Authority for meeting any liability arising out of
the use of any vehicle. The fund has to be established in accordance
with the Rules framed under the MV Act 1988. 9. Requirements of Policies
The policy is required to be issued by an ‗authorised insurer&rsquo;, i.e. an
insurer in whose case the requirements of the Insurance Act, 1938, are
complied with. Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 requires that
the policy of insurance must provide cover: i. Against any liability
which may be incurred by the insured in respect of death of or bodily
injury to any person, including owner of the goods or his authorised
representative carried in the carriage, or i.. Damage to any property of a third party; or</p>
<p>i.. Against death or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service
vehicle, caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public
place.</p>
<p>The policy, however, shall not be required to cover: i.Any contractual liability; or</p>
<p>i.. Any liability in respect of death arising out of and in the course of
employment of the employee of the insured, or in respect of bodily
injury sustained by such employee arising of out of and in the course of
his employment. The policy must, however, cover liability arising under
the Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act, 1923 in respect of death or bodily
injury to any such employee, (a) Engaged in driving the vehicle, or (b)
Engaged as conductor or ticket examiner in a public service vehicle, or
(c) If it is a goods carriage, being carried in the vehicle.</p>
<p>Whereas Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act, 1923 imposes a liability on the
employer to pay compensation to ‗Employee&rsquo; for accidents arising ‗out of
and in the course of employment&rsquo;, it does not make it compulsory for the
employer to insure that risk. But, the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 makes it
compulsory for the owners of vehicle to insure their liability under the
Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act, 1923 towards certain categories of
‗Employee&rsquo; employed in connection with motor vehicles. In practice motor
policy is extended to cover owner&rsquo;s liability towards ‗workmen&rsquo; also
under Common law and Fatal Accidents Act on payment of a nominal per
capita extra premium. Liability towards fare-paying passengers is
required to be compulsory insured. The MV Act, 1988 thus recognises
motor vehicles owners&rsquo; responsibility towards passengers who pay for
their carriage in the vehicle e.g. passenger in an autorickshaw, taxi,
ambulance, hearse, postal vans or a passenger bus. Compulsory insurance
is also required in respect of passengers who are carried ―by reason of
or in pursuance of a contract of employment‖.</p>
<h2 id="a-by-reason-of-or-in-pursuance-of-a-contract-of-employment">a) By reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment</h2>
<p>The expression, ―by reason of or
in pursuance of a contract of employment‖, requires explanation. A
passenger would be carried ―by reason of‖ his contract of employment, if
he is allowed by the employer to travel in the vehicle as an aid to the
work or if he is ordered by the employer to travel in the vehicle. On
the other hand, if the contract of employment gives a right to the
passenger to travel in the vehicle as a part of service conditions, the
conveyance will be ―in pursuance of‖ the contract.</p>
<p>b) Limits of Liability: A policy of insurance is required to cover any
liability incurred in respect of an accident i.</p>
<p>There is unlimited liability for third party death or personal injury.
This would cast upon the insurance companies the duty to satisfy the
entire judgement, and no proportion thereof, can be shared by the
insured unless the liability of the insurer is exonerated in terms of
the statutory defenses contained in Section 149(2) of the Act 1988. The
amendment of 1994 includes in the various provisions of the Act also the
provisions of the Section 163(A) &ndash; ‗structured formula&rsquo; introduced by
Amendment Act 1994.</p>
<p>ii. In respect of damage to any property of a third party out of one
accident, a limit of Rs. 6,000/- (Rupees six thousand only). As per the
Act ‗Property&rsquo; includes goods carried in the Motor Vehicle, roads,
bridges, culverts, causeways, trees, posts and milestones. Insurers in
India are providing increased coverage for property damage viz. Two
wheelers Rs. 1,00,000/-; other vehicles Rs. 7,50,000/-. This increased
cover does not include goods carried on the vehicle.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Duty of Insurers to Satisfy Judgments</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Section 149 of 1988 Act provides that: If,
after a Certificate of Insurance complying with compulsory insurance
provisions of the Act 1988 has been issued, judgment for compulsory
third party liability is obtained against an insured person, and then
the insurer has to pay to the third party the amount decreed plus costs
and interest awarded, subject to the sum insured under the policy. The
important point to be noted here is that the insurers have to pay the
third parties even though they may be entitled to avoid or cancel the
policy or may have avoided or cancelled the policy.</p>
<h2 id="a-rights-of-insurers">a) Rights of Insurers</h2>
<p>Before the commencement of the proceedings, the insurers are
entitled to receive notice through the Court or the Claims Tribunals, as
the case may be, of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any
judgment awarded so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an
appeal. The insurer who receives the notice is entitled to be made a
party thereto and to defend the action only on any of the following
grounds given Section 149 (2): Section 149 (2): (A). There has been
breach of a specified condition of the Policy, being one of the
following conditions, viz.: i.</p>
<p>A condition excluding the use of the vehicle: (a) For hire or reward,
where vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not
covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward, or</p>
<p>(b) For organised racing and speed testing, or (c) For a purpose not
allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used, where the vehicle
is a transport vehicle, or (d) Without side-car being attached, where
the vehicle is a motor-cycle; or i.</p>
<p>. A condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by any
person who is not duly licensed, or by any person who has been
disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving license during the
period of disqualification; or</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. A condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by
conditions of war, civil war, or civil commotion; or</p>
<p>Section 149 (2): (B) That the policy is void on the ground that it was
obtained by non-disclosure of a material fact or by representation of
fact which was false in some material particular. The insurer can evade
liability only by raising successfully any of the defenses listed above
and not by any other manner. For insurers are impleaded in the suit
Condition 2 of the Motor policy requires the insured to give notice to
insurance Company about the suit. The Act, however, provides that any
sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability of
any person which is covered by the Policy by virtue only of this proviso
shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person. 11. Rights of
Third Parties against Insurers on Insolvency of the Insured Section 150
of 1988 Act provides for the rights of third parties in the event of the
insolvency of the insured or in the event of winding up, when the
insured is a Company. The Act provides that if, either before or after
that event, any third party liability is incurred by the insured, his
rights against the insurer under the Policy are transferred to the third
party to whom the liability was incurred. When such transfer takes
place, the insurer will be under the similar liability to the third
party as he would have been to the insured person, but: a) If the
liability of the insurer to the insured person exceeds the liability of
the insured person to the third party, the insured person&rsquo;s rights
against the insurer in respect of the excess are not affected. For
Example: the Act provides for TPPD to the extent of Rs. 6,000/- only,
whereas the insurers liability under Private Car policy is Rs.
7,50,000/-. Thus the TP claimant will be entitled to claim up to
7,50,000/-</p>
<p>b) If the liability of the insurer to the insured person is less than
the liability of the insured person to the third party, the rights of
the third party against the insured person in respect of the balance are
not affected. In the event of an insured becoming insolvent or making
arrangements with his creditors (insured is a company, being wound up)
the rights of the insured under the policy will be transferred to and
vest in the injured third party. In other words the injured third party
is able to recover compensation direct from the insurers. In the absence
of this provision, any sum recovered by the insolvent insured from his
insurance company would have formed part of his assets to which his
creditors would lay a claim in proportion to their debts.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Settlement between Insurers and Insured Persons</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Section 152 of 1988 Act provides
that no settlement made by the insurer in respect of third party
liability is valid unless the third party concerned is a party to the
settlement. Further Section 152 provides that when the insured becomes
insolvent (or if the insured is company is wound up) no agreement made
between the insurer and the insured person (after liability has been
incurred after insolvency, and winding up proceedings have been
commenced) shall be effective to defeat the rights transferred to the
third parties.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Effect of Death of Insured Person</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Section 155 of 1988
Act provides that if the insured person dies after incurring third party
liability, then the cause of action survives against the insured&rsquo;s
estate, or legal heirs or against the insurer. If this provision was not
made, then the third party&rsquo;s right of action against the negligent owner
of the vehicle would die with the death of the owner. This explains why
the Third Party section of a Motor policy always contains a paragraph
stating that the company will indemnify the insured&rsquo;s legal
representative in terms of the policy in the event of the insured&rsquo;s
death.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Duty to Furnish Information</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>a) Section 151 of 1988 Act casts
a duty on a person who has incurred a liability to a third party to
disclose all particulars of his insurance if demanded by the third
party. The duty also applies to the insurer who is expected to give an
inspection of the policy and other documents to the injured party. b)
Section 160 of 1988 Act provides that a Registration Authority or the
officer in charge of a Police station is required to furnish
identification marks of the vehicle and the name and address of the
person using the vehicle at the time of accident or of the injured
person,</p>
<p>i.THIRD PARTY CLAIMS MANAGEMENT IN INDIA</p>
<p>if required by a third party who alleges that he is entitled to claim
compensation in respect of an accident; or</p>
<p>i . If required by an insurer against whom a claim has been made in
respect of any Motor vehicle. The liability to pay compensation for
victim&rsquo;s accident arises under the law of tort, i.e. the motorist&rsquo;s
negligence has to be established. The majority of these victims are from
the weaker and poorer sections of the society who neither have any
knowledge of the legal remedies available to them nor the financial
means to pursue them. Besides, if the third party is guilty of his
contributory negligence, then the compensation is scaled down depending
upon the degree of contributory negligence. The question of negligence
has to be decided in a Court of Law or Tribunal and litigation is
prolonged and expensive process. Trials of claims cases before Courts or
Tribunals are generally long drawn out and involve considerable trouble
and expenditure to the claimants for compensation. Thus, insistence on
proof of negligence is said to cause great hardship to claimants.
Compensation is awarded only after the Tribunal is satisfied on the
aspect of negligence. The Supreme Court and several High Courts had
repeatedly observed that social justice and a sense of humanity require
that the principle of ‗No Fault liability&rsquo; should be adopted in
automobile accidents. Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, Chapter X Section 140 to
144 deals with No-Fault liability.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Liability without Fault</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-section-140">a) Section 140</h2>
<p>Section 140 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides as follows:
Where the death or permanent disablement of any person has resulted from
an accident arising out of the use of a motor vehicle or motor vehicles,
the owners of the vehicles shall, jointly and severally, be liable to
pay compensation in respect of such death or disablement in accordance
with the provisions of this section. The amount of compensation which
shall be payable under sub-section (1) in respect of the death of any
person shall be a fixed sum of Rs. 50,000 (fifty thousand rupees) and
the amount of compensation payable under the subsection in respect of
the permanent disablement of any person shall be a fixed sum of Rs.
25,000 (twenty five thousand rupees). (1939 Act, the amounts were Rs.
15,000/- and Rs. 7,500/- respectively.</p>
<p>In any claim for compensation under sub-section (1), the claimant shall
not be required to plead and establish that the death or permanent
disablement in respect of which the claim has been made was due to any
wrongful act, neglect or default of the owner or owners of the vehicle
or vehicles concerned or of any other person. A claim for compensation
under sub-section (1), shall not be defeated by reason of any wrongful
act, neglect or default of the person in respect of whose death or
permanent disablement the claim has been made nor shall the quantum of
compensation recoverable in respect of such death or permanent
disablement be reduced on the basis of the share of such person in the
responsibility for such death or permanent disablement. Notwithstanding
anything contained in sub-section (2) regarding death or bodily injury
to any person, for which the owner of the vehicle is liable to give
compensation for relief, he is also liable to pay compensation under any
other law for the time being in force: Provided the amount of such
compensation to be given under any other law shall be reduced from the
amount of compensation payable under this section or under Section 163A.
An analysis of the provisions reveals the following: i.</p>
<p>The claimant involved in a motor vehicle accident is not required to
prove wrongful act, neglect, or default (i.e. negligence) on the part of
the owner of the vehicle or by any other person.</p>
<p>.i</p>
<p>. The claim under these provisions is not defeated or affected in any
way, by any wrongful act, neglect or default on the part of the
claimant; nor can be quantum of compensation be reduced on the basis of
the claimant&rsquo;s share of responsibility for the accident. In other words,
the legal defense of „contributory negligence‟ is not available to
themotorist and his insurer.</p>
<p>.i</p>
<p>. These provisions apply in cases where the claimant suffers death or
permanent disablement, as defined in the Act (See Para 15 a Section
140).</p>
<p>iv. The object behind no-fault principle is to give minimum statutory
relief expeditiously to the victim of the road accident or his legal
representative. To that extent, this provision constitutes a measure of
social justice. Where no-fault liability is concerned, there is clearly
a departure from the usual common law principle, that a claimant should
establish negligence on the part of the owner or driver of the motor
vehicle before claiming any compensation for death or permanent
disablement arising out of a motor vehicle accident.</p>
<h2 id="b-section-142">b) Section 142</h2>
<p>Section 142 provides that permanent disablement of a
person shall mean any injuries or injuries involving:</p>
<p>i.Permanent privation of the sight of either eye or the hearing of either
ear, or privation of any member or joint; or</p>
<p>i.. Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or
joint; or</p>
<p>i.. Permanent disfiguration of the head or face.</p>
<h2 id="c-section-141-1">c) Section 141 (1)</h2>
<p>Section 141 (1) of 1988 Act reads as follows: The
right to claim compensation under Section 140 in respect of death or
permanent disablement of any person shall be in addition to any other
right (referred to as the right on the principle of fault) to claim
compensation in respect thereof, under any other provision of this Act
or of any other law for the time being in force. Thus, it will be seen
that claims for death or permanent disablement can also be pursued under
other provisions of the Act on the basis of negligence. The motorist is
liable to pay compensation on the basis of „No Fault‟ as well as on the
basis of „Fault‟ or negligence. he has to pay first the compensation on
‗No fault&rsquo; basis. If such compensation paid is less than the
compensation awarded on the principle of ‗fault&rsquo; or ‗negligence&rsquo;, the
motorist is liable to pay the balance.</p>
<p>Example For example, if Rs. 30,000/- is awarded for permanent
disablement on the basis of negligence, the claimant is entitled to
receive only Rs. 5,000/- being the excess over the no-fault compensation
settled first. On the other hand, if the amount of compensation paid on
the basis of ‗no fault&rsquo; is equal to or more than the amount of
compensation payable on the basis of ‗fault&rsquo; or ‗negligence&rsquo;, then the
claimant is not entitled to receive the compensation awarded on the
basis of negligence.</p>
<p>Example For example, if the claimant has received compensation of Rs.
25,000/- for permanent disablement on ‗no fault&rsquo; basis and is awarded
Rs. 25,000/- or say Rs. 15,000/- on ‗no fault ‗basis, he is not entitled
for this second mentioned compensation. This means that if the
compensation on the principle of fault liability is less than the amount
awarded under no-fault liability, then the Insurers are not entitled to
recover the excess payment from the insured made under nofault
liability; but if it is more, then the difference between the two
compensation amounts will be required to be paid by the insurers. The
Amendment Act 1994, amended Section 141 to make it clear that the right
to claim compensation in terms of new structural formula referred to in
section 163 (A) &ndash; described later in this chapter shall not be an
additional benefit. Both the benefits are mutually exclusive. Section
143 lays down that the provisions of Chapter X of the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1988 dealing with liability without fault shall also apply in
relation to any claim for compensation in respect of death or permanent
disablement of any person under the Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act, 1923,
resulting from a motor accident. The Time limit for depositing
compensation under this section is one month d) Section 163 (A) Sections
163 (A) and 163 (B) are newly added by the Amendment Act of 1994
effective from 14th November 1994: (a) Section 163 (A) contains special
provision as to payment of compensation on &ldquo;structural formula basis&rdquo;.
This is a new provision for payment of compensation to road accident
victims as per determined formula. The amount of compensation payable to
claimants is calculated in a tabular form and shown in the Second
Schedule which appears as an annexure to the Amendment Act, 1994 (b) In
case of fatal accidents a table of compensation is provided showing the
amounts payable depending on the age of the victim and the multiplier
applicable. The amount of compensation so arrived at in case of fatal
accident claims is reduced by one-third in consideration of the expenses
which the victim would have incurred towards maintaining himself, had he
been alive.</p>
<p>(c) Under the Schedule, the amount of such compensation shall not be
less than a specified amount (currently Rs. 50,000/-). (d) Besides the
amount of compensation outlined above for fatal cases, the schedule also
indicates: i.</p>
<p>General Damages of specified amounts payable in case of death for: 
Funeral expenses  Loss of consortium, if beneficiary is the spouse 
Loss of estate  Medical expenses, that is, actual expenses incurred
before death, supported by bills / vouchers, not exceeding a specified
amount</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. General Damages of specified amount are payable in case of injuries
and disabilities for:  Pain and suffering for grievous and non-grievous
injuries  Medical expenses, that is, actual expenses incurred supported
by bills/vouchers not exceeding, as onetime payment, specified amount.</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Disability in non-fatal accidents: Compensation for loss of Income, if
any, for actual period of disablement not exceeding 52 weeks, PLUS
either of the following:  In case of payment total disablement, the
amount payable shall be arrived at by multiplying the annual loss of
income by the ―multiplier‖ applicable to the age on the date of
determining the compensation, or  In case of permanent partial
disablement, such percentage of compensation which would have been
payable in the case of permanent total disablement as specified in the
above item.</p>
<p>(e) The Schedule also specifies notional income of non-earning
persons. In any claim for compensation under this Section, the claimant
shall NOT be required to plead or establish that the death or permanent
disablement in respect of which the claim has been made was due to any
wrongful act or neglect or default of the owner(s) of the vehicle(s)
concerned or of any other person.</p>
<p>Thus, the compensation mentioned in the Schedule shall be payable on the
basis of ―No Fault‖. However, the scheme is optional, and if the
claimant feels that the amount prescribed in the Schedule is not
acceptable, a claim can be filed under the existing provisions, that is,
under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. e) Section 163 (B) When a
person is entitled to claim compensation under Section 140 and Section
163 (A), he shall file the claim under either of the said sections and
not under both. The adjudicating authorities in all cases would be Motor
Accidents Claims Tribunals (MACT). The Government is empowered to revise
the Schedule keeping in view the changes in the level of cost of living.
The Amendment Act, 1994 amended Section 141 to make it clear that the
right to claim compensation in terms of new structured formula referred
to in Section 163 (A) &ndash; shall not be an additional benefit. Both the
benefits are mutually exclusive.</p>

<li>Hit and Run Accident</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 is a piece of social legislation and its provisions
are designed to protect the rights of victims of road accidents. In
spite of the wide protection afforded by the provisions of the Act,
there remain certain gaps in which the road victims may not have any
remedies.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p>If the identity of the motor vehicle causing the accident cannot
be established and, as a result, the victim has no recourse to any legal
remedies; he cannot proceed against either the owner of the vehicle or
the insurance company which had insured the vehicle. The Motor Vehicles
Act, 1939 was amended, with effect from 1st October, 1982. A new Chapter
VII-A was added dealing with ―liability without fault in certain cases‖
and Hit &amp; Run cases. In this new Chapter VII-A, Section 109-A to C dealt
with claims arising out of „hit and run‟ accidents. In the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988, Sections 161, 162, and 163 of Chapter XI deal with
‗hit and run&rsquo; accidents.</p>
<p>THIRD PARTY CLAIMS MANAGEMENT IN INDIA</p>
<p>The Law Commission in its 51st Report had recommended amendment of the
Motor Vehicles Act 1988 to provide for compensation in ―hit and run‖
cases. The recommended legislative provision was as follows: a) Where an
accident, involving the death or bodily injury to a person caused by or
arising out of the use of a motor vehicle occurs, and it is proved that
a claim for compensation in respect of such accident cannot be made
because the person liable to pay such accident cannot be ascertained
after reasonable efforts, the person entitled to such compensation shall
be entitled to receive it from the State. b) Where in respect of any
accident, any claim is made under sub-section (1) and it is found that
the claimant has received or is entitled to receive, any sum as
compensation or, indemnity from any person other than the driver or
owner of the motor vehicle which occasioned the death or bodily injury,
the amount to be awarded to the claimant against the State under
sub-section (1) shall be reduced by that sum.‖ This Section proposes to
provide for payment of compensation (Solatium) as follows: c) In respect
of the death of any person resulting from a hit and run motor accident,
now a fixed sum of Rs. 50,000/- (currently Rs. 25,000/-). d) In respect
of grievous hurt to any person resulting from a hit and run motor
accident, now a fixed sum of Rs. 25,000/- (Currently Rs. 12,500/).</p>
<p>Definition Section 161 defines ―hit and run motor accident‖ as accident
arising out of the use of a motor vehicle or motor vehicles the identity
whereof cannot be ascertained in spite of reasonable efforts for the
purpose. According to this Section, ―grievous hurt‖ shall have the same
meaning as in the Indian Penal Code. Any hurt which endangers life or
which causes the sufferer to be during the space of twenty days in
severe bodily pain or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. According
to Section 320 of the Indian Penal Code the following kinds of hurt are
designated as ‗grievous: i. Emasculation i.. Permanent privation of the sight of eye.</p>
<p>i.. Permanent privation of the hearing of either ear.</p>
<p>iv. Privation of any member or joint. v. Destruction or permanent
impairing of the powers of any member or joint. vi. Permanent
disfiguration of the head or face. vi . Fracture or dislocation of a
bone or tooth. The Solatium was payable out of a ―Solatium Fund‖
established by the Central Government with effect from 1st October,
1982. According to the earlier Amended Act, the finances of the Solatium
Fund consisted of contributions from i.</p>
<p>Central and State Governments &ndash; 30%</p>
<p>i . General Insurance Industry &ndash; 70% It is the Indian insurers who
would now pay compensation as per the Scheme framed by Central
Government. Section 162 allows refund of payment made under Section 161
where compensation is awarded by MACT in such cases and paid by insurers
separately. The Section states that payment of compensation for death or
grievous hurt under Section 161 above shall be subject to the condition
that if any compensation or other amount is awarded or paid in respect
of such death or grievous hurt under any other provisions of this Act or
any other law or otherwise, so much of the other compensation or other
amount aforesaid as is equal to the compensation paid under Section 161,
shall be refunded to the insurer. Before awarding compensation, the
Claims Tribunal, Court or other authority has to verify whether
compensation has already been paid under Section 161 or an application
for payment of compensation is pending. If the compensation has already
been paid under Section 161 then the Tribunal or Court, as the case may
be, should direct the person liable to pay compensation awarded by it to
refund to the insurer so much thereof as is required to be refunded. On
the other hand, if an application for payment of compensation is pending
under Section 161, it should forward the particulars as to the
compensation awarded by it to the insurer.</p>
<h2 id="test-yourself-2">Test Yourself 2</h2>
<p>As per the 'limits of liability' specified in the MV
Act, in respect of damage to any property of a third party out of one
accident, the limit is . I. Rs. 6,000/II. Rs. 12,500 III. Rs. 25,000 IV.
Rs. 50,000 C. Who can claim Compensation? 1. Who can prefer Claims? The
following persons can prefer claims for death or disability due to
negligence of the driver of a vehicle: a) Pedestrians Pedestrian has a
right to use the footpath but also to use the road occasionally and also
to cross it. b) Fare paying passengers The passengers carried in a
public service vehicle are called fare-paying passenger. The owner of
the vehicle is under a legal duty to provide road worthy vehicles but
also to appoint competent drivers having effective valid driving
licence. The owner&rsquo;s responsibility commences from the time a passenger
enters the vehicle and continues until the passenger un-boards from the
vehicle safely. c) Non-fare paying passengers The duty of owner towards
non-fare paying passengers is to exercise reasonable skill and care and
to provide reasonably safe mode of conveyance. d) Persons travelling in
other vehicles These persons may be driver, passenger or owner of the
other vehicles who expect the other driver to drive safely. e) Children
The driver is required to show extra care towards children present on
the road, as law does not expect a child to exercise the same degree of
care as an adult has to exercise. 324</p>
<h2 id="2-doctrine-of-res-ipsa-loquitur">2. Doctrine of Res Ipsa Loquitur</h2>
<p>The fact that an accident has occurred
is not considered in law as prima facie evidence of negligence. The
burden of establishing negligence in a motor vehicle accident claim for
compensation lies on the claimant. This burden is considerably lessened
by the application of the maxim res ipsa loquitur means that the
accident speaks for itself or tells its own story. The burden will then
be on the defendant to establish that the accident has happened due to
some cause other than their own negligence.</p>
<h2 id="a-prima-facie-negligence">a) Prima facie negligence</h2>
<p>If vehicle climbs on a pavement causing bodily injuries to pedestrians
walking on the footpath, then the circumstances indicate that there has
been prima facie negligence and the claimants need not prove negligence.
In fact the onus will shift to driver to prove that he was not
negligent. Under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, the plaintiff
establishes a prima facie case of negligence where: It is not possible
for him to prove precisely what was the relevant act or omission which
set in train the events leading to the accident; and i. Failure to take
proper care: On the evidence as it stands at the relevant time it is
more likely than not that the effective cause of the accident was some
act or omission of the defendant or of someone for whom the defendant is
responsible, which act or omission constitute a failure to take proper
care of the plaintiff&rsquo;s safety. Effect of the application of the maxim
res ipsa loquitur i.</p>
<p>. Indian Position: For the application of this maxim, there is no better
authority in India than the words of the Apex Court [(Pushpa Bai
Purushottam Udeshi and ors Vs. Ranjit Giinning And Pressing Co. and
another) 1977 ACJ 343 (SC)]. Vehicle capsizing has been held covered by
res ipsa loquitur [2008 (2) LW 1096].</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Though the doctrine is a rule of evidence and not a norm of
substantive law, it would suffice for a claimant to establish the
primordial ingredient of the initial presumption against a driver for
establishing negligence. The burden would then shift to the tort feasor
to rebut this presumption to escape liability, e.g., the sketch cannot
be the basis to affix negligence or apply the maxim res ipsa loquitur.
Oral evidence is very important. The burden of proof for negligence, on
claimants, is very heavy; res Ipsa loquitur can be invoked.</p>
<h2 id="b-non-applicability-of-doctrine-of-res-ipsa-loquitur">b) Non applicability of doctrine of res ipsa loquitur</h2>
<p>Claimants failed
to discharge the initial burden: Where the claimants failed to discharge
the initial burden of proving the rash and negligent driving [1982 ACJ
(Suppl.) 56 All (DB)], there was no burden on the insurer on behalf of
the owner of truck which hit a cyclist while crossing a bridge, to prove
careful driving of the vehicle. In other words the doctrine res ipsa
loquitur will apply only when the claimant was unable to prove the
nature of occurrence of the accident. Res ipsa loquitur is only a means
of estimating logical probability from the circumstances of the
accident.</p>
<h2 id="c-cause-of-accident-is-known">c) Cause of accident is known</h2>
<p>The doctrine of res ipsa
loquitur would not apply when the cause of accident is known. Similarly
where the injured and his witnesses were in full knowledge of the facts
and circumstances of the accident and had intentionally withheld the
truth from the court [1982 ACJ (Suppl.) 401 (HP)] the doctrine of res
ipsa loquitur wouldn&rsquo;t be attracted. It is clear that the doctrine of
res ipsa loquitur will apply only when there was no evidence to lead the
court to the conclusion, with regard to the incident for the purpose of
fastening the liability and finding who the defaulting party was [1986
ACJ 405 (Alld.)]</p>
<h2 id="d-due-precaution">d) Due precaution</h2>
<p>A driver attempted to cross a bridge
overflowing with knee-deep water, as the river was in spate due to
adverse weather condition. [1994 ACJ 116 (Madras)] The bridge
collapsed and the bus was washed away causing death of the passenger. It
was held to be negligence of driver for not taking due precaution while
driving and it could not be accepted as an Act of God.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Defences‟ against Negligence</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>An allegation of negligence may be rebutted by the
following defences:</p>
<h2 id="a-volenti-non-fit-injuria">a) Volenti Non-fit injuria</h2>
<p>This means that if a
person voluntarily consents to run the risk, the question of negligence
does not arise. This defence may arise in passenger liability claims.
When a person has, of his own willingness and consent decided to become
a passenger in a public service vehicle, then he cannot complain of
matters ordinarily incidental to traffic to which the vehicle will be
exposed.</p>
<h2 id="b-inevitable-accident">b) Inevitable Accident</h2>
<p>Inevitable accident is an accident which occurs
despite ordinary care, caution, and skill. The burden to prove
inevitable accident rests upon the driver of the vehicle. He must
establish the cause of the accident and also that the result of that
cause was inevitable.</p>
<h2 id="c-act-of-god">c) Act of God</h2>
<p>An act of God is a direct, violent,
sudden, and irresistible act of nature, which cannot be foreseen with
reasonable care e.g., storms, lightning, earthquake, etc.</p>
<h2 id="d-emergency">d) Emergency</h2>
<p>If the injury is caused to a person who has placed himself in a
situation of imminent danger to himself, no negligence will be
attributed. Sometimes a pedestrian using a road may unexpectedly cause
the driver of oncoming vehicle, to take turn to save him, and thereby
cause injury to another pedestrian. In such circumstances the driver
would be able to raise the defense of emergency. He will not be blamed,
merely because he does not do the right thing in the circumstances,
which are referred to as an agony of the moment.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Vicarious Liability</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>What is the basis of doctrine of vicarious liability?</p>
<h2 id="definition-1">Definition</h2>
<p>Vicarious means that takes or supplies the place of another.
(Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd Edition 1944, and Vol. 2nd)
Vicarious liability means that one person takes the place of another so
far as liability is concerned. .</p>
<p>Certainly by the turn of this century it was clearly established that
the liability of a master was based not on the fiction that he had
impliedly commended his servant to do what he had done tortuously, but
on the more safe and simple ground, that it had been in the scope or
during the course of his employment or authority. Although this
relationship of master and servant is by far the most important in which
vicarious liability is recognised by the law but it is not confined
merely to it. It follows that those for whose negligence a person may be
liable must be considered under the following headings:</p>
<p>Servants, Agents, His children, Independent contractors</p>
<h2 id="a-owner-and-driver-joint-tort-feasor-in-motor-accident">a) Owner and Driver Joint tort-feasor in Motor accident</h2>
<p>Both the owner
and driver are joint tort-feasors. In motor accident the primary
liability is that of the driver and once the driver is found negligent,
the owner is vicariously liable, and liability of insurance company is
an imputed liability contemplated statutorily. In other words, the
liability of owner and driver being joint tort feasor is joint and
several and applicant is entitled to recover the compensation from
driver too. In a case where the joint tort feasor were held to be at
fault, it was held that apportionment need not be made as liability was
joint and several.</p>
<h2 id="b-latent-defect-in-the-machine">b) Latent Defect in the machine</h2>
<p>On the question of
negligence it is often pleaded by the tort feasor that the accident was
not caused by their negligence but due to latent defect in the machine.
However, by a series of decisions it is by now settled that where such a
plea is raised the burden is squarely on the party thus pleading to
prove the latent defect. Not only this, it is incumbent on them to prove
that they had regularly maintained the vehicle and repaired it and in
spite of such reasonable care, latent defect persisted and the accident
ensued. Thus the burden is cast and escape route to a tort-feasor is
hindered.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Contributory and Composite Negligence</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Contributory
negligence would arise where Z had contributed to the occurrence of the
accident. Where Z had no involvement in the accident, but the accident
was caused due to the combined negligence of A &amp; B then it would be a
case of composite negligence. If due to the negligence of A and B, Z has
been injured, Z can sue both A and B for the whole damage. There is a
clear distinction between contributory negligence and composite
negligence. The composite negligence liability is joint and several. The
term contributory negligence applies solely to the conduct of the
plaintiff. It means that there has been an act or omission on his part,
which has materially contributed to the damage. But in case of composite
negligence the plaintiff himself has no hand in the occurrence of the
accident. The difference between the two is of great importance in motor
accident claims. If it is a case of composite negligence then no
reduction in compensation payable to a claimant would occur whereas, in
contributory negligence the claimant&rsquo;s compensation would be reduced in
proportion to his share in the negligent act. 328</p>
<h2 id="a-apportionment-in-composite-negligence">a) Apportionment in composite negligence</h2>
<p>When it is composite
negligence, there is the added question, whether apportionment of
compensation needs to be made between the tort-feasor in the ratio 50:50
or in the ratio of their shares in the negligent act. It needs to be
emphasised that composite negligence would mean joint and several
liability to the tort-feasor. The claimant would be at liberty to sue
either of the joint tort-feasor or both of them, if he so chooses. The
joint tort-feasor would be liable for the entire compensation. As the
liability is joint and several, the joint tort-feasor would be liable
for the entire claim and it would be for the claimants to choose against
whom he would execute ([Refer (Devaki Nandan Bangar vs. State of
Haryana), 1995 ACJ 1288(P.H)]; [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd, vs.
Narendra Kaur and ors).2002 ACJ 1716(P.H): (Narendra Pal Singh vs.
Punjab State,) 1989 ACJ 728(P.H)]; the claim. The distinction needs to
be well understood for the good of the Motor accident victims. While
some decisions have chosen to hold that there was no need to apportion
liability as liability was joint and several, there are others which
have held that the Court had a duty to apportion liability because it
was enjoined to do so by virtue of (Sec.110-B of 1939 Act) now Section
168 of MV Act 1988 as the Court had to fix the shares of driver, owner
and insurer. Further contention is that such apportionment would
dispense with the need for further litigation to fix inter se liability
and thus avoid multiplicity of proceedings. Even while apportionment was
made, the Courts were duty bound to observe that the claimants could
execute 100% against either and there was no compulsion to execute the
award only at 50:50 etc. In a given case, if two vehicles were involved
and one was not insured, it would mean a lot to the interests of the
victims. If the Court were to hold that apportionment was 50:50 and the
claimants did not have the right to proceed for 100% against the insured
vehicle, then the claimants may be left in the lurch, with no hope to
realise 50% of the award. If, on the other hand the Court holds that
notwithstanding such apportionment, it was open to the claimants to seek
100% from either of the parties, the interests of the victims would be
well guarded. It would be for the party paying up the entire award to
seek contribution from the other. The ultimate decision on this point is
available in [(Ganesh vs. Syed Munned Ahamed) - 2000 ACJ 1463]</p>
<h2 id="6-contributory-negligence">6. Contributory Negligence</h2>
<p>Where an accident is caused due to the
negligence of both the parties, substantially there would be
contributory negligence and both would be blamed. Where vehicles collide
the apportionment at 50:50 would be fair. The crucial question on which
the liability depends in contributory negligence relates to whether
either party by exercise of reasonable care, has avoided the consequence
of others negligence that would be liable for the accident. In order to
hold that there was contributory negligence, there must be positive and
credible evidence adduced by the respondents.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>In a case, where the injured was riding TVS 50 and was hit by a
Transport Corporation bus from behind, there was no contributory
negligence held in this case. If a person&rsquo;s negligent act or omission
was the proximate and immediate cause of death, the fact that the person
suffering injury was himself negligent and also contributed to the
accident or other circumstances by which the injury was caused, would
not afford a defence to the other. Contributory negligence is applicable
solely to the conduct of a person who has materially contributed to the
damage, the act of omission being of such a nature that it may properly
be described as negligence, although negligence is not given its usual
meaning.</p>
<h2 id="a-travelling-on-the-ladder-attached">a) Travelling on the Ladder Attached</h2>
<p>The injured was travelling
on the ladder attached to the bus on the rear. The apportionment was
made on negligence at 30:70 between the driver and passenger.
Interestingly, the insurer of the bus was held not liable, as the
injured was not a passenger. [(Satyawan vs. Rashid Khan) 2007 ACJ 1396
(P&amp;H)]</p>
<h2 id="b-engaged-in-agricultural-operations">b) Engaged in Agricultural operations</h2>
<p>The deceased was engaged
in agricultural operations, using the public road as thrashing floor,
when the accident occurred. It was held that there was an element of
contributory negligence in such conduct and hence the award was reduced
by 30% for such contribution.</p>
<h2 id="c-head-jutting-out">c) Head Jutting Out</h2>
<p>Where the passenger
had his head jutting out and there was an accident with a colliding
vehicle, liability was apportioned between the driver and the claimant
at 50:50.</p>
<h2 id="d-carrying-two-pillion-riders-or-absence-of-driving-licence-for-rider">d) Carrying Two Pillion Riders or Absence of Driving Licence for Rider</h2>
<p>The Tribunal found in the claim for the death of a motorcyclist, who was
carrying two pillion riders, that the driver had also contributed to the
occurrence. However, it was held that without any evidence to show
contributory negligence, it cannot be inferred from the absence of
driving licence for the rider or from carriage of two pillion riders by
itself. [(Manjo Bee vs. Sajjad Khan) 2007 ACJ 737 (MP)] Where the
victim was a 10-year-old girl, it was held that no contributory
negligence could be attributed to her. [(Giata Bai Vs. Himachal Road
Transport Corporation) 2007 ACJ 1061 (HP)] In a very peculiar case, the
victim had fallen into a well and suffered injuries. He was rescued and
rushed to a hospital. While being taken in a taxi, there was a motor
accident and he died on the spot. It was held that the claim was
tenable; however, since the victim had already suffered injuries by the
fall into the well, the award could be reduced by 50% applying the maxim
of contributory negligence.</p>
<h2 id="e-apportioning-liability-in-contributory-negligence">e) Apportioning liability in contributory negligence</h2>
<p>Apportionment means reduction to such an extent as the court
thinks just and equitable having regard to the claim shared in the
responsibility for the damage. But in a case where there has been no
contributory negligence on the part of the victim the question of
apportionment does not arise. i. In a case filed under Section 163-A,
the Court would not be right in apportioning liability on the basis of
contributory negligence. [(Ramkanyabai Vs. Unav Transport Co (P) Ltd)
2007 ACJ 2003 (MP)] i.</p>
<p>. The finding that scooterist was to blame for the mishap was set aside
in appeal on the ground that the driver of the mini bus did not get into
the witness box. [(Oriental Insurance Co Ltd Vs. Narayani Modi) 2007
ACJ 1723 (MP)]</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Application of notional income for an agriculturist was found to be in
order. [(Ponnumany alias Krishnan Vs. V.A.Mohanan) 2008 (7) MLJ 269
(SC)]</p>
<p>iv. The finding of the Tribunal that the rider of the 2-wheeler and the
bus driver were guilty at 50:50 was reversed holding that mere
exoneration of the bus driver by the criminal court was not a valid
circumstance to hold. [(R.Duraisamy vs D.Arumguham) 2007 (4) LW 500
(Mad)]</p>
<h2 id="7-composite-negligence">7. Composite Negligence</h2>
<p>Where a person is injured without any
negligence on his part but as a result of the combined effect of the
negligence of two other persons, it is not a case of contributory
negligence but a case of injury by composite negligence. Negligence is a
careless conduct, although there may not be any duty to take care.
Negligence also refers to breach of legal duty to take care. In
[Lochgelly Iron and Coal Co. vs. M. Mullan, 1934 A.C.I.] Lord Wright
pointed out negligence means more than needless or careless commission;
it properly connotes the complex concepts of duty, breach and damage
thereby suffered by the person in whom the duty owed.Entire case law has
been discussed in [2007 (4) ACC 631 (All) (DB]). In a case of
composite negligence, only Transport Corporation Bus was made party, the
other Private Bus was not impleaded. It was held that Transport
Corporation cannot complain about finding on negligence. [2007 (2) TN
MAC 563] Where both the vehicles were insured with the same company,
each need not be impleaded twice over as both are liable jointly and
severally. As the insurer on the insurance policy gave no evidence,
hence the insurer was held liable. [2007 (2) TN MAC 510 (Mad)] In case
of head-on collision, if one of the drivers does not enter the box, then
the finding that only one driver was at fault is correct. [2007 4 ACC
123 (MP)]. In case of head-on collision the apportionment of liability
equally between the drivers was upheld. [(Gujarat State Road Transport
Corporation vs. Hargovinddas R. Modi) 2007 ACJ 1198 (Guj)]. In another
case it was found that there was a collision between a tractor and a van
and in the prosecution launched against the tractor driver he had chosen
to admit his guilt. In the said circumstances, the finding that both
drivers were to blame was set aside and the tractor driver alone was
held to be at fault.[( Oriental Insurance Co Ltd vs. Vijaya) 2007 ACJ
2105 (Mad)]</p>
<h2 id="a-apportionment-on-the-type-of-vehicle">a) Apportionment on the type of vehicle</h2>
<p>In case of
composite negligence two vehicles are involved and the injury / death is
sustained by a third person. The negligence is apportioned on the basis
of the type of vehicle involved. The proportionate liability in case of
two similar vehicles may be 50% on each vehicle. Apportionment of
liability in a case of composite negligence was held to be improper.
[(Kusumben Vipinchandra Shah vs. Arvindbhai Narmadashankar Raval) 2007
AIHC 2392 (Guj)]. In a case where the joint tort feasors were held to
be at fault, it was held that apportionment need not be made as
liability was joint and several. In a case of composite negligence,
there is no question of apportionment of liability at 50:50, as
liability is joint and several.</p>
<h2 id="b-apportionment-for-heavy-and-medium-transport-vehicle">b) Apportionment for Heavy and Medium transport vehicle</h2>
<p>i. heavy
vehicle vis a vis medium transport vehicle, the apportionment may be
60%-40% respectively. There was a collision between a bus and lorry and
it was held in appeal that since in the connected claims both drivers
were held to be at fault, the finding should be the same in other
connected claims too. Liability should be apportioned between the two
drivers at 50:50. [(S.Palaniswamy vs. Chinnakali) 2007 (2) TN MAC 147

at 75:25. [(Sumitra Sana vs. Ramsakha Chourasia) 2007 ACJ 1718 (MP)].</p>
<h2 id="c-liability-joint-and-several">c) Liability joint and several</h2>
<p>When two vehicles collide, and only one
driver was prosecuted is not material; the apportionment was made at
50:50. Where two vehicles were involved in the accident and only one
vehicle was impleaded and both drivers were found to be at fault at
50:50, the claimants were held entitled only for 50%; since they had
failed to implead the other vehicle. [(Kuldeep Singh vs. Indrajeet
Singh Kohli) 2007 ACJ 2383 (Uttara)] In a case of composite negligence,
the choice to sue either or both was with the claimant and as such the
claimant was entitled to 100% from the impleaded truck and it was for
this truck to seek reimbursement, if any, from the other truck in
separate proceedings. [(Mayaram vs. Mehboob) 2007 ACJ 918 (MP)]:
[(Nani vs. Soma La) 2007 ACJ 1163 (Raj)]. A Full Bench decision of the
Karnataka High Court in [2000 ACJ 1463] was not brought to the notice
of the Single Judge at Supreme Court. In that decision it was held that
in case of composite negligence, liability being joint and several,
notwithstanding such apportionment, it was permissible for the claimants
to execute the entire award against either of the tortfeasors. It was
held that where the claim was lodged against only one of the
tort-feasors, the Tribunal was not bound to apportion liability, as it
would be an exercise in futility. [(Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport

<p>Where a passenger

required to pay to the extent of permitted seating capacity, by choosing
the highest awarded amounts of claims, which is distributed amongst all

<p>Where the injured or deceased is
an Employee as per definition under Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act, 1923,
the liability of the insurer to pay compensation is limited to the
extent as prescribed unless there is a wider coverage under Package
Policy. The co-owner was engaged as driver of the Tractor &amp; was
receiving salary died in a tractor accident [Pushpabai vs. Ramotibai
2002 (&amp;) ACJ 1341 (MP)]. Although the co-owner was being employed as
driver but he does not cease to be co-owner, hence no compensation is
payable under Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act, 1923.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Sovereign Immunity</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The Courts in India have uniformly deprecated the tendency of the State
to raise plea of sovereign immunity. The crux of the reasoning is that
the State would be entitled to raise the defence successfully only where
it can prove that the function, in which the vehicle was involved, was
an exclusive sovereign function in which no private individual could
have been engaged. If the act, during which the accident ensued, could
be accomplished by a private individual, then the plea of the sovereign
immunity falls flat. Even where military trucks are involved, the plea
is not allowed to be agitated as it must not be.</p>
<h2 id="9-effect-of-criminal-trial-before-mact">9. Effect of Criminal Trial before MACT</h2>
<p>As the degree of proof required
for Criminal trial is higher, the decision of the criminal case would
not have direct bearing on the outcome of Claims Tribunal. However if
the driver voluntarily pleads guilty, it would be prima facie proof of
negligence. Though a plea of guilt rendered before the Criminal Trial,
on a similar analogy cannot be of a great significance, it would be
relevant while fixing the liability for the accident before a Claims
Tribunal. It is a settled law that the proceedings before a Criminal
Trial are not binding on the Claims Tribunal as held in [1980 ACJ
435].</p>
<h2 id="a-effect-of-conviction">a) Effect of Conviction</h2>
<p>The drivers pleading guilty to the charge
of non-possession of driving license does not give any chance to the
insurer to escape liability. The acquittal of driver will not exonerate
the owner of the statutory liability under MACT and the latter would
have to independently arrive at its own conclusion for affixing the
liability.</p>
<h2 id="b-effect-of-acquittal">b) Effect of Acquittal</h2>
<p>The plea that criminal case has
resulted in the acquittal and that the MACT must follow suit, was
rejected in [N.K.V.S. Bros (P) Ltd vs. V.S.M. Karumari Ammal 1980 ACJ
435 (SC)]. The requirement of culpable rash and negligent driving is
essential for the purpose of awarding compensation by the Tribunal and
this right is not prejudiced by the acquittal in criminal case.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Legal Representatives</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The third party liability claims for compensation
are made in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury
to persons arising out of the use of the vehicles, or damage to property
of third party, or both under Section 166 of 1988 Act. Application for
such compensation may be made by the person who has sustained injury or
by the owner of property or where death has resulted from the accident,
by all or any of the legal representatives of the deceased, as the case
may be. There is clear departure from the provisions of the Fatal
Accidents Act, 1855 where, such action or suit could only be brought for
the benefit of the wife, husband, parent or children of the deceased /
injured as the case may be. The question of brothers and sisters, more
so when they are major and independent, has been the cause of great
conflict for claiming compensation under Motor Vehicle Act 1988.</p>
<h2 id="11-definition-of-legal-representative">11. Definition of Legal Representative</h2>
<p>The definition of term legal
representative is found in Rule 2 (C) of Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles
Accident Claims Tribunal Rules 1989.</p>
<p>Definition Legal representatives shall have the meaning assigned to it
under Clause (ii) of Section 2 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Central
Act of 1908). Section 2 (11) of CPC which reads as under: Legal
representative means a person who in law represents the estate of a
deceased person and includes any person who intermeddles with the estate
of the deceased and where a party, sues or sued in a representative
character, the person on whom the estate devolves on the death of the
party to suing or sued. The brothers and sisters of the deceased person,
even if not dependent on the deceased, though married, are entitled to
compensation. Where the father is himself an earning member, he is not a
dependent. In a claim petition, the widow and the father of the deceased
were the claimants, the father passed away, pending suit for action. The
brother of the widow was not allowed to be impleaded as legal heir of
father of her husband.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Dependent under EC Act 1923</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act, 1923 is a beneficial legislation. The statute itself
contains the list of persons entitled for the claim. Unlike in the case
of a MACT claim dependency is irrelevant. Mere relationship would
suffice under the 1923 Act, and if named in the statute as widow,
mother, and children or even widowed sister etc., the claimant becomes
entitled to the statutory compensation as a matter of right. The statute
itself provides for the ‗Factor&rsquo; to be adopted for the age of the
victim, and as for wages, in the face of proof thereof, that shall be
the wages. In its absence or it being lesser than minimum wages for the
notified workmen category, the Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Commissioner can
and may have to rely upon minimum wages to compute the compensation
payable. It would be suffice for the claimant to be an identified
dependent as per the statute to sustain an EC claim. Liability under EC
Act, 1923 is absolute while in a MACT claim, proof of negligence of the
tort feasor is mandatory as held in Maimoon Bi case [1977 ACJ 118
(SC)]. But in the case of an EC claim, it would suffice if the victim
was a workman / employee and accident arose in the course of employment
and the claim arose out of it. Even if the victim was at fault himself,
he can sustain the claim.</p>
<p>Probably, a difficult defence for the employer / insurer would be that
the workman was willfully negligent. A totally impossible defense to
sustain and avoid liability, since mere negligent driving or prosecution
by the police or even conviction arising from admission of guilt before
a criminal court, would not be proof of willful conduct. Requirement of
burden of proof to avoid liability in a EC claim is hard to come by.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Legal Representative and Dependency</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>It is true that the legal
representative shall be construed to be wider in amplitude than legal
heir as is commonly understood. But while arriving at ‗Just
compensation&rsquo;, the court has to necessarily arrive at the dependency of
the claimants. It is the settled law for the purpose of dependency that
the proof of actual reliance on the deceased for upkeep and survival
would matter and not mere relationship. Of course, for the widow,
children and parents, such consideration of dependency is in built and
accepted as given. But if the claimants were brothers or sisters or even
married children living separately, dependency becomes an important
criterion. In case all the legal heirs of the deceased are in active
service, they are still entitled to make a claim under the 1988 Act.
Their claim cannot be rejected on the ground that they are not
dependents on the deceased. Such an approach is opposed to the purpose
of legislation and the beneficiary will be a tort-feasor.</p>
<h2 id="a-adoption-of-the-minor">a) Adoption of the minor</h2>
<p>In a case the claim was by the natural father along with
second wife claiming adoption of the child from the natural mother. It
was found that the natural mother was financing the child and in fact
was seeking to get back the custody. The claim for death of boy was held
maintainable at the instance of natural mother only. [(The Oriental
Insurance Co Ltd v Lalitha Sharma) 2007 ACJ 1033 (HP)]. Where the
Tribunal came to note that there were other legal representatives also
in the case but were not impleaded, it had a duty to award their shares
from and out of the compensation. In another case the adoption of a
minor daughter was held not acceptable in the absence of authentic
evidence to this effect. Further, the claim of the parents for the death
of their daughter was held sustainable on proof of dependency, and the
non- impleading of the husband, who was alive but living separately in
illegal intimacy with another woman was held to not affect the claim by
parents. [(Minor Shyamala v A. Madheswaran) 2007 (2) TN MAC 478 (Mad)]</p>
<h2 id="b-claim-on-the-basis-of-a-will">b) Claim on the basis of a Will</h2>
<p>An appeal by an injured claimant,
seeking enhancement, would not lie after the death of the injured
pending such appeal. The claim on the basis of a Will was negative, and
it was ruled that such a person cannot invoke the benefit when the
finding was that she was not a legal heir or dependent of the deceased.
She could work out her remedies by proving the will before a Civil
Court. [(Jillelamudi Nagamani v Sarvepalli Vijayalakshmi) 2007 (3) ACC
35 (AP)] It can, therefore, be safely inferred that when persons such
as widow, husband, children or parents are available, brothers and
sisters cannot claim to be legal representatives. But in the absence of
first mentioned persons, brothers and sisters can claim compensation
under the held legal representatives within the meaning of relevant
sections under MV Act 1988</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Dependency under EC Act 1923</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Whether dependency would be a major factor in motor accident as in Employee&rsquo;s
Compensation Act, 1923, in considering maintainability is a question
that has been a bone of contention for long. An employee is entitled to
move either the, Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Commissioner or the MACT but
not both under the MV Act 1988. In fact, in the claim petition drafted
under Claims Tribunal Rules, verification column requires the claimant
to solemnly affirm that he had not received any compensation under the
provisions of the Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act, 1923. Similar position
has been restated in case of ESI Act where if an employee could sustain
a claim under Section 53 of ESI Act for compensation, he could not file
a claim petition under MV Act 1988. Where a claimant happens to be an
employee they need not prove negligence for receiving compensation
payable to them under the provisions of Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act,
1923. An employee remains a claimant even where he was himself negligent
e.g., a driver or where workman is unable to establish negligence, then
also he can maintain a claim before the Claims Tribunal in view of the
application of the procedural law applicable to MV Act1988. a) Option to
move EC Commissioner or Motor Accident Claims Tribunal As per Section
167 of MV Act, 1988 it is open to the workman to exercise an option to
move MACT or go before the EC Commissioner. But on the exercise of
option there are differing views. If the claimant moves the Commissioner
and the employer admits liability and deposits compensation, then the
workman can be said to have exercised his option.</p>
<p>b) Employer complies with the Mandate If, however, the employer,
complies with the mandate of Section 10-A of EC Act, 1923 and on his own
admits liability and deposits the compensation, which the workman
chooses to withdraw, then he cannot be said to have exercised his option
to seek compensation. He may still be entitled to seek the remedy before
MACT but technically, they may not pass muster if the language of
Section 167 is read properly. For each claim, there can only be one
remedy. Insurers may be justified to resist any claim arising before
MACT after the workman had received compensation under WC Act, 1923 or
was covered under ESI Act, of which Section 53 is a bar for any further
claim. c) Employee to Sue in MACT in No Negligence Cases In the context
of EC claim, where negligence is not a pre-requisite and not a bar to
sustain the claim of a workman, there has been development in the legal
position enabling the workman / driver to sue before MACT also. The
Supreme Court upheld a MACT claim for the death of an auto rickshaw
driver who was found murdered for gain [(Rita Devi) - 2001 ACJ 801
(SC)], which was held to be an accidental murder. Where the victim is
an employee under EC Act 1923 [{Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Mani} 2004
ACJ 1790 (Mad DB)], and he could legally enforce a claim before MACT
also, but his entitlement would be restricted to such sum payable under
EC Act, 1923. d) NFL limit for Workman at fault Where the workman /
driver was himself at fault and would appear to have admitted his guilt
and been convicted thereupon. The liability of insurer may be restricted
only up to NFL [(Nandakumars case) 1996 ACJ 555 (SC)]. However, that
decision may now have to be read in line with the march of law that if
he was a workman then such liability may be as per EC Act, 1923 and not
as per NFL alone.</p>

<p>Claims for compensation for liability
under the Motor Vehicles Act arise out of negligence and fall under the
law of torts. As this is a civil matter, the remedy is to file a suit in
a civil court. This was the procedure to be followed in the initial
years even after the introduction of the MV Act. However, the long drawn
out procedure of proving negligence and increasing number of cases
resulted in a pile-up of pending matters in civil courts. This was
against the principle of social justice as the claimants did not get
timely relief. They also incurred exorbitant expenses on court fees and
other legal charges.</p>

<li>Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>For the speedy
disposal of third party claims and at a minimum cost, the Claims
Tribunals have been constituted by different State Governments, under
Section 110 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. Such tribunals are presided
over by a person of the rank of a District Judge or High Court Judge.
Only a nominal fee has to be paid for instituting a case and court fee
is not based on the value of the suit. Thus it is very much less
expensive and poor third party claimants are not prevented from making
proper claims. All third party claims for personal injury and property
damage up to Rs. 6,000/- have to be filed with claims tribunals.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Beneficial Legislation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Chapters X to XII of 1988 Act was incorporated
for the benefit of the innocent motor accident victims. There has been a
sea change in the purport and impact of the march of law from the
dispensation under MV Act 1939 to MV Act 1988 and subsequent amendments
down all these years. The Parliament in its wisdom has gone about
securing and protecting the interests of the affected victims. The
Courts are duty bound to keep in mind the beneficial intent behind this
legislation. The construction of the statutory provision is itself in
consonance with this intendment. (National Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs.
Swaran Singh) 2004 ACJ 1: AIR 2004 SC 1531: 2004 (3) SCC 297: 2004 (1)
Supreme 243: 2004 (1) ACC 1] a) Quicker Justice It was felt that the
ordinary Civil Courts could not deal with Third Party Claims and
expeditiously grant relief to the victims. As it is, the judicial
process is very slow and time-consuming in the Indian context. It would
appear that time had come to cry for Judgment, not Justice. Bearing this
in mind, Parliament had directed the constitution of Claims Tribunals as
specialised forums in the hope that they would handle and deliver
justice in time, in these cases.</p>
<p>The expectation, to be fair, has been belied. The exponential increase
in the motor accidents, the failure to increase the number of ‗Claims
Tribunals‟ and the procedural wrangles indulged in by the lawmen in
their genius has meant that lots of the victims have only been pitiable.
The need then was felt to introduce ‗No Fault Liability‟ under Section
140 of the 1988 Act and then came Section 163-A ‗structured Schedule
Compensation‟ for all cases of death, based on proof of age and income.
They thought that there could be a Table of computation of compensation,
to fix the compensation payable instantly. Similarly, for injury claims
too there could be a Table of Computation of compensation. With regard
to the vexed question of ‗assessment of disability‟ which is now within
the whims and fancy of stock witnesses appearing before Tribunals, there
could be constitution of Medical Boards in all Districts, which shall
have the final say in the assessment based on the guidelines issued by
the Ministry of Social Justice Women Empowerment dated 1st June 2001.
Then alone, it may be possible to see quicker dispensation of justice.
Even then, we should not rule out the genius of the lawmen to quibble on
legalese to keep the victims at bay.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Jurisdiction of Claims Tribunal</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Section 165 of the 1988 Act gives the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals
(MACT) exclusive jurisdiction to decide the claims with regard to death,
personal injury as well as property damage, irrespective of the amount
involved in the property damaged, whether on fault basis or &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo;
basis. An explanation has been added to Section 165 of 1988 Act Any
application for claim filed with the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals on
basis of ‗fault&rsquo; shall also contain a separate statement that a claim
for compensation on ‗no fault&rsquo; basis is also made. Thus an important
change was made by the new Section 165 in granting exclusive
jurisdiction to MACT, empowering the claimant to take up claims for
damage to property without any limit. However, under Section 147 (2)(b)
the limit for compulsory T.P. Property damage remains at Rs. 6,000/-
only. The jurisdiction of the claims Tribunal is now a matter of
clarity, what with the Supreme Court upholding its right to deal with
claims involving trains too, on level crossings. [Union of India Vs.
Bhagwati Prasad 2002 ACJ 721 : AIR 2002 SC 1301 : 2002 (3) SCC 661 :
2002 (2) Supreme 272] The State Government may, by notification in
official Gazette, constitute one or more Motor Accidents Claims
Tribunals (MACT), for such area as may be specified in the notification,
for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect
of accidents involving death of, or bodily injury to, persons arising
out of use of motor vehicles, or damages to any property of a third
party so arising or both.</p>
<p>There is no mention of the term public place therein, which infers that
even with regard to claims occurring in private place, claims could be
lodged before the MACT. Nevertheless, so far as insurers are concerned,
the policy of insurance is required to cover only accidents occurring in
public places within the meaning of Section 2(24) of the Motor Vehicles
Act 1988. Power of Civil Court: The Claims Tribunal no doubt had come
into being. But the Supreme Court had ruled that creation of the Claims
Tribunal was only a forum creation. The law relating to liability would
still be in the realm of Torts and Common Law [1977 ACJ 118 (SC)]. To
sustain a claim based on Torts, the claimants would have to establish
fault on the part of the tort-feasor. The Claims Tribunal was vested
with exclusive jurisdiction to decide such claims.</p>
<h2 id="a-claims-tribunal-is-vested-with-power-of-civil-court">a) Claims Tribunal is vested with power of Civil Court</h2>
<p>Precisely speaking, Claims Tribunal is
vested with the power of Civil Court, for the purpose of taking evidence
and compelling the discovery and production of documents and material
objects and for other purposes in disposal of claim brought before it.
The MACT Rules have not made applicable in specific terms, all
provisions of Civil Procedure Code e.g., Order 1, Rule 10 (2) of CPC
refers to the owner to allow parties to be impleaded during the conduct
of proceedings. [1980 ACJ 298 (SC)] it was held that the powers under
CPC can be invoked as ancillary powers required for the valid and proper
adjudication of claim by a MACT.</p>
<h2 id="b-exercise-of-powers---transferring-of-petition">b) Exercise of Powers - Transferring of petition</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court has categorically stated that High Court
ought to treat the Tribunals as Courts [1983 ACJ 123 (SC)] for the
purpose of transferring claims petitions from one Tribunal to another.
Supreme Court has transferred claims petitions from one state to another
when sufficient cause was shown. It is now a settled principle that once
the matter reaches the High Court, all provisions of CPC would be
applicable as it hears the appeals as an original appellate court.</p>
<h2 id="c-letters-patent-appeal">c) Letters Patent Appeal</h2>
<p>The same analogy when applied to Letters Patent

co. Ltd &amp; Anors. 2002 ACJ 210 (SC)]. But the power of Latent Patent
Appeal has been taken away consequent to insertion of Section 100-A of
the Code of Civil Procedure by Amendment Act 922 of 2002) in respect of

<h2 id="e-limitation-on-jurisdiction">e) Limitation on Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>An owner travelling in the vehicle
made a claim against the State Government for the action of a Policeman.
The policeman apprehended that the lorry was transporting some
contraband material, threw a plank of wood with nails on it against the
tyre of running lorry, causing overturning of the vehicle. The claims
Tribunal was found bereft of jurisdiction to entertain such claim
petition having been constituted under Section 110 of MV Act 1939 as the
respondents were neither driver, nor owner nor insurer of the lorry. The
jurisdiction depends on whether there had been any use of motor vehicle
and it cannot be ousted on a finding at a later point of time that it
was the negligence of a Train and not the Motor Vehicle in question
[Union of India vs. Bhagwathi Prasad &amp; Ors. 2002 ACJ 721 (SC 3j)].
MACT is empowered to pass two different awards under Section 163-A and
Section 166 arising out of the same accident filed by different
claimants. [2003 ACJ 2053 (P&amp;H)]. However the claims Tribunal cannot
inquire into compensation that can be claimed and awarded under
Employees Compensation Act, 1923 on the basis of statutorily imposed
strict liability under the said 1988 Act.</p>
<h2 id="f-place-to-sue">f) Place to sue</h2>

<p>The claimant has a choice of forum. At the instance of claimant a claim
filed at Sivakasi as per his Ration Card was held to be in order. As
long as the claimants were not guilty of forum shopping there was no
justification to reject the claim at the fag end of trial of the case
[(P.Pandiammal v Anand) 2008 (7) MLJ 996.] An employee&rsquo;s compensation
claim was filed at Tezpur where the parents of the deceased claimed that
they were residing and making their livelihood. The employer on the
premise that accident had occurred at Nalgaon contested it. The Supreme
Court upheld the claim filed at Tezpur on the ground that the claim was
filed where the claimants were ‗ordinarily residing‟ and which was
permissible under the beneficial legislation. The contention of the
employer that claim of the parents on their residence was not supported
by documentary proof was rejected in the absence of crossexamination of
the testimony of the claimants, on their residential status.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Forum Shopping</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>In view of this clouded state of affairs and prejudice to the
cause of victims, Parliament deemed it appropriate to introduce a change
by which the claimants could institute the claims at their place of
residence too, under Section 166 of MV Act 1988. This welfare measure is
within a beneficial legislation, akin to Section 60 of Copyright Act.
There is a regretful practice of forum shopping based on convenience of,
not necessarily victims but of lawyers too. It is an undeniable reality
that this arena is infested with the vice like grip of ambulance
chasers. In such circumstances, one is a witness to the fact of claim
petitions being instituted on the basis of ‗forum shopping&rsquo; at the
convenience of the counsel on record with assumed addresses
euphemistically portrayed as now residing at. The ordinary residence of
the claimant is shifted for the convenience of every one.</p>
<h2 id="a-duplication-of-claims">a) Duplication of Claims</h2>
<p>This choice of forum has caused untold hardships to the
community of respondents. In cases where ‗2 vehicles are involved‟,
there have been instances of 2 claims being lodged in 2 different places
against 2 different owner&rsquo;s and insurer&rsquo;s, without either of them
smelling a rat. There was no cross verification possible to weed out
this menace earlier but the advent of Core Insurance this is checked to
a great extent. Further, the insurers also face claims by ‗rival legal
heirs‟ before different forums impleading different offices of their
choice. The insurers have been seen to be paying up from both ends for
different sets of claimants where no centralised communication set up
available. And if they discover, by chance the fact, it may be too late
as well on some occasions.</p>
<h2 id="b-suggestion-for-checking-the-menace-of-forum-shopping">b) Suggestion for checking the menace of forum shopping</h2>
<p>As for transfer
of such claims petitions, there could be a provision introduced to vest
the Tribunals themselves with such power much like those under EC Act,
1923 even for inter-state transfers, leave alone transfers within a
State, ridding the appellate forums of the need to address these
problems. It is always possible that a provision can be provided in the
MACT Rules of each State insisting upon production of proof of ordinary
residence to maintain the claim before the concerned Tribunal to place a
premium on assumed addresses leading to forum shopping.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Parties to the Claim Petition</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>It is to be noted that as per Section 2(30), owner
means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered and where
such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor and in relation to a
motor vehicle which is the subject matter of hire purchase agreement or
an agreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in
possession of vehicle under agreement. The hire purchaser/ lessee are
the owner of the vehicle under Section 147 read with Section 2(30) of MV
Act 1988. The husband of the deceased had settled the claim with the
owner of the vehicle for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and entered into an
agreement accepting the sum in full quietly and agreeing not to prefer
any further claim. Notwithstanding such agreement, a claim was pursued
and the Claims Tribunal dismissed the same, as not sustainable. However,
on appeal, the High Court ruled that such a settlement for a sum lesser
than even statutory no fault liability, was not binding on the
claimants. In another case it was held that the settlement between
husband of deceased and owner is not valid and binding. Under Section
140, the injured, or in case of death of heirs, his legal representative
can file a claim petition in Form I under Rule 4(1), where the
respondents are the owners or insurers of the offending vehicle. An
interim compensation may be passed against any one owner of the vehicle
involved in the accident, without impleading owner of the other vehicle.
Under Section 166 the injured or in case of death of his heirs the legal
representatives can file a claim petition in Form II under Rule 4(1) and
(2) where respondents are owner of the vehicle, insurer and driver of
the offending vehicle, as there is no provision in the Act on this
aspect. The financier of the motor vehicle under Hire Purchase agreement
is not a necessary party in proceedings, as question of breach of terms
of hire purchase is beyond the scope of adjudication before the
tribunal.</p>
<h2 id="a-damage-to-third-party-property--loss-of-income">a) Damage to third party property / loss of income</h2>
<p>The Claims Tribunal
as constituted under Section 110-A of MV Act can entertain the claim for
damage to property as long as there is a physical connotation to it. But
claim for loss of income due to inability to use the vehicle, can be
laid only before a Civil Court.</p>
<h2 id="b-condoning-delay-to-file-claim">b) Condoning delay to file claim</h2>
<p>The Claims Tribunal was initially vested with the jurisdiction to condone
delay in filing claim petition on sufficient cause being shown within
the meaning of Section 110 A (3) of MV Act 1939. Later Section 166 (3)
of MV Act 1988 provided that claim petition had to be filed within six
months of occurrence of the accident with a proviso to condone the delay
for sufficient cause provided the application is filed within 12 months
from the date of occurrence. However this Section 166 (3) was omitted
under amended Act 54 of 1994. Therefore, effective position as on date
is that, there is no bar on period of limitation under the 1988 Act
currently in force for filing a motor third party claim. The Claims
Tribunal is required to entertain claim petition regardless of date on
which accident took place.</p>
<h2 id="c-evidence-without-formal-proof">c) Evidence without formal proof</h2>
<p>Certified copies of FIR, inspection map, site inspection memo, panchnama, injury
report or post mortem report and other documents prepared by Police or
Physician while discharging official duty are admissible as evidence
without any formal proof. A true copy of Insurance Policy is admissible
in evidence under Section 74 read with Section 77 of the Evidence Act
without any formal proof, when the petition did not contain particulars
of offending vehicle and the owner failed to produce the original Policy
even after notice under the 1988 Act.</p>
<h2 id="d-appeal-provision-under-motor-vehicle-act-1988">d) Appeal Provision under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988</h2>
<p>Section 173 provides for provision of filing Appeal
for a person aggrieved by an award of MACT. However, there is a bar on
filing appeal for an award of a Claims Tribunal if the amount in dispute
is less than ten thousand rupees. However, there is no bar for an amount
in excess of Rs. 10,000/- if awarded by the Claims Tribunal. Section 173
&ndash; Appeals: Any person aggrieved by an award of the Tribunal, derives
right to file an appeal under this Section, within a period of ninety
days from the date of award. Further an appeal cannot be admitted for
consideration or maintained without deposit of Rs. 25000/- or fifty
percent of the amount awarded, whichever is less, by the person required
to pay the award. Any subsequent deposit of half of the amount is not
considered compliance of the mandatory requirement and is liable to be
rejected at the admission stage</p>
<p>However, the party who is awarded with the liability cannot file an
appeal unless he deposits 50% of the award or a sum of Rs.25,000/-
whichever is less, along with the appeal. No appeal can be filed against
the order of the Tribunal if the amount involved is less than
Rs.10,000/-. Under Order 41 Rule 22 of C.P.C read with Section 173 of
the 1988 Act, cross objection tantamount to appeal. Therefore, without
mandatory deposit the appeal provision under Section 173 is not
maintainable. The insurance company cannot question the compensation
awarded by the Claims Tribunal by filing a joint appeal, as it would
result in a mockery of Section 149 (2) where insurance company is not
entitled to seek relief directly, it cannot be allowed to seek relief
indirectly allowing joint appeal. The benign principle that justice
shall not suffer because of hyper technicalities is clearly understood
and though a joint appeal is not maintainable, the appeal by the owner
deleting the insurer is maintainable [Asha &amp; ors vs. United India
Insurance Company Ltd &amp; Anors. 2004 ACJ 448 (SC)].</p>

<hr>
<p>Third party risk in the background of a vehicle which is the
subject matter of insurance is dealt in Chapter XI &amp; XII of the Motor
Vehicle Act 1988. Proviso to Section 147 of the 1988 Act reads as
hereunder: ―A policy shall not be required (i) to cover liability in
respect of the death arising out of and in the course of his employment,
of the employee of a person insured by the policy or in respect of
bodily injury sustained by such an employee arising out of and in the
course of his employment other than a liability arising under the
Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923) in respect of the death of
or bodily injury to, any such employee: i.</p>
<p>Engaged in driving the vehicle or</p>
<p>i.. If it is a public service vehicle engaged as Conductor of the vehicle
or in examining Tickets on the vehicles, or</p>
<p>i.. If it is a goods carriage, being carried in the vehicle.</p>
<p>It has been held in in the case of a cheque having been dishonoured; the
insurer under Section 147 of 1988 Act, having issued the Motor Insurance
Policy is mandated to pay &amp; recover, as the contractual liability has
become void ab initio for want of consideration, which failed due to
dishonour of premium cheque [2008 ACJ 1111]. It has been clarified
that direction to insurer to pay and recover from the insured cannot be
carried so far as to issue such directions, where there was no contract
of insurance in force on the date of accident. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<h2 id="a-insurer-to-pay-and-recover-from-owner">a) Insurer to pay and recover from owner</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court observed
that it would be equitable if the insurance company pays the amount of
compensation to the claimant and recovers it from the insured. Where the
driver did not hold a valid endorsement, the insurer was directed to pay
and seek recovery from the insured. [(Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v
Yudhishter Joshi) 2007 (3) TAC 440 (Uttara)] The interest of justice
will be sub-served if the appellant insurance company herein is directed
to satisfy the awarded amount in favour of the claimant, if not already
satisfied and recover the same from the owner of the vehicle. The
insurer was called upon to pay the claim and seek recovery from the
insured on the ground that the insured&rsquo;s driver held a fake driving
licence. The insurer had gone up to the apex court and lost their case.
When, however, they sought to recover from the insured under Section
174, the insured contested and took the matter on revision contending
that the finding of the MACT on breach by insured was not proper.
Agreeing with the contention, the direction to recover was set aside and
matter remitted for fresh disposal on this issue.</p>
<h2 id="b-no-need-to-file-a-suit-for-recovery">b) No need to file a suit for recovery</h2>
<p>Therefore, it has been held that it would be equitable
if the insurance company pays the amount of compensation to the claimant
and recovers it from the insured. For the purpose of such recovery, it
would not be necessary for insurer to file a separate suit but the
Insurer may initiate a proceeding before the executing court, as if the
dispute between the insurer and the owner was the subject matter of
determination before the Claims Tribunal, and the issue was decided
against the owner and in favour of the insurer. Before release of the
amount to the claimant, owner of the vehicle shall be issued a notice
and he shall be required to furnish security for the entire amount,
which the insurer will pay to the claimants. The offending vehicle shall
be attached, as part of the security. If necessity arises the Executing
Court shall take assistance of the concerned Regional Transport
Authority. The Executing Court shall pass appropriate orders in
accordance with law as to the manner in which the insured, owner of the
vehicle shall make payment to the insurer. In case there is any default
it shall be open to the Executing Court to direct realisation by
disposal of the securities to be furnished or from any other property or
properties of the owner of the vehicle, the insured.</p>
<h2 id="c-tribunals-to-hear-claims-for-damage-to-property-and-revenue-loss">c) Tribunals to hear claims for damage to property and revenue loss</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, the creation of the claims tribunal was a creation of the
statute. Under MV Act, 1988, any limitation for a TPPD claim has been
removed. If so, even a claim under the head revenue loss has to be laid
before the Tribunal only, as there is total ouster of jurisdiction of
the civil court from entertaining any claim in relation to a motor
accident claim. One important development in this arena is the decision
of the Apex Court that in case of Motor accident on unmanned railway
crossing involving trains, if the claims were against the owners and
drivers of Motor vehicles too, then such claims would be tenable before
the Tribunal. There was no necessity for the victims to sue before a
Civil Court or elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="d-tribunals-possess-powers-and-trappings-of-civil-court">d) Tribunals possess powers and trappings of Civil Court</h2>
<p>Coming to the powers of the Tribunals, it is now well
settled that the Tribunals have all the powers and trappings of a Civil
Court. It is not a Civil Court per se, is true. It is a Tribunal and is
created by a statute. Nevertheless, it has now arisen from a series of
judgments from the Supreme Court downwards that such Tribunals would
have all powers required and necessary for invocation of Civil Procedure
Code for this purpose. They have repeatedly ruled that to render justice
among the parties, the Tribunals can invoke such inherent powers. The
relief of impleading parties or amendment of claim petitions to enhance
the claim or change the pleadings or record legal representatives on
deaths of claimants, or restoration of claim petition dismissed for
default or set aside an ex parte decree against a respondent are all now
mechanically accepted as applicable. Every single provision of CPC was
applicable before Tribunals, irrespective of whether MV Act or the
relevant rules had held them applicable before it.</p>
<h2 id="e-power-of-review">e) Power of review</h2>
<p>One important adjunct of the power of a Civil Court being available to
the MACT is the power in relation to review or recall of an award
against the insurer. Power of review is a specific power and the legal
position is that unless such power was vested with a Tribunal, it cannot
invoke the right. In fact, in criminal jurisprudence, there is a bar on
Magistrates to invoke any such power of review. Fraud and justice: It
was for the first time [in (United India Insurance Co. Ltd v Rajendra
Singh) 2000 ACJ 1032] and [in (Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v R. Mani)
2000 ACJ 247 (Mad)] that such power of review was recognised and vested
with the MACT. It was in the context of proceedings initiated by the
insurers that the claims were tainted and fraudulent and, therefore,
there was an abuse of process of law. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>In that context, the relief sought by the insurer to review / recall the
award already passed against them, was upheld by the Supreme Court and
reliance was placed on Section 151 and Section 152 CPC for this purpose
(residual powers). Fraud and justice can never dwell together and if so,
the Tribunal, which had rendered the award, could in appropriate cases,
invoke the inherent powers read with Sections 151 and 152 of CPC and
review / recall the awards already passed. In the context of the
existence of fabricated motor accidents claims all over India, this
power is very significant for the entire insurance industry to protect
itself. It needs to be understood that such power of review may have no
power of limitation also. Normally, such power of review shall be
invoked within 30 days of the order. But [in (United India Insurance
Co. Ltd Vs. Rajendra Singh) 2000 ACJ 1032], insurer became aware of the
fraud after 4 months of the award. Still the relief was upheld as
available. Further such power of review is traced to inherent power of a
Tribunal and Sections 151 and 152 CPC and not Or.47 R.1 CPC or Section
114 CPC, for which alone a period of limitation is prescribed under
Limitation Act, 1963. Hence, the insurers can legitimately seek the
power of review in appropriate cases where they became aware of the
fraud subsequently and they had not already contested claim as being
fabricated and adduced no evidence to this effect also, without fear of
the relief being time-barred. f) Limitations to file Appeal Once an
award is passed the award has to be deposited within 30 days from the
date of its announcement as given under Section 168(3) unless either
party decides to go in appeal. Section 173 stipulates that any person
aggrieved by an award of the Tribunal, derives right to file an appeal
under this Section, within a period of ninety days from the date of
award. However, the party who is fixed with the liability cannot file an
appeal unless he deposits 50% of the award or a sum of Rs.25,000/-
whichever is less, along with the appeal. No appeal can be filed against
the order of the Tribunal if the amount involved is less than
Rs.10,000/-. As the High Court is a constitutional Court. Hence, it has
all the powers and trappings of such court, without a glitch. Limitation
to file appeals is of course prescribed under the 1988 Act. In case of
delay, an application has to be moved before High Court for condonation
of delay. It would make sense to lodge appeals within the stipulated
period of 90 days in case of MACT claims and 60 days in case of EC
claims. For, if there is a delay in filing such appeal, then as per
Or.41 R. 3 (3A) of CPC, there shall be a bar on the High Court from
granting interim relief, pending disposal of the application for delay.
Only after condonation of delay, any stay can be sought for. 350</p>
<p>Insurers cannot seek any other alternate remedy of injunction against
execution, as law does not permit another remedy if the basic remedy is
barred and circumvention of the legal process is not permissible. Coming
to the powers of the High Court, it is for the individual High Court to
frame rules for hearing the appeals by a Single Judge or Division Bench,
depending on the stakes. The insurers have a statutory right to file an
appeal under Section 173 of MV Act, 1988. But it would be subject to the
High Court entertaining it. It is open to the High Court to dismiss the
appeal at the stage of admission itself, if it did not see merit in the
case.. But the legal position is as yet not fully settled, in the
absence of a verdict of the Supreme Court and there is divergence of
opinion.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Power of Execution, Appeal and Revision Petition</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>All the powers of a Civil Court are, therefore, available to both Tribunals and
the High Court. Powers of execution to MACT, as of a Civil Court under
Or.21, are available to the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. The High
Court can exercise the power of transferring claim petitions within the
State from one District to another under Section 24 of CPC. Under
Section 173 no appeal is provided for if the amount in dispute is less
than Rs. 10,000/-. But in cases such as no insurance, no coverage for a
pillion rider, or unauthorised occupant in a goods vehicle etc., even if
the amount in dispute is less than Rs. 10,000/- insurers can invoke the
remedy of a revision petition or a writ petition under Article 227 of
Constitution of India. It is true that Supreme Court has ruled that when
an appeal remedy was available, the insurer cannot file such a revision
petition. But that is distinguishable in this case, where an appeal
remedy is not otherwise available. Such appeals have to be filed within
90 days of the award, excluding the time taken to obtain the award copy
and in case of revision petition as above; there is no period of
limitation prescribed.</p>
<h2 id="a-period-of-limitation-and-territorial-jurisdiction">a) Period of limitation and territorial jurisdiction</h2>
<p>As per amended MV Act, 1988 as of 14/11/94 there is no
period of limitation envisaged for filing Motor accident claims. In
respect of claims, which have not been lodged already or not dismissed
by any Court of law, any claimant can sue today safely. That is, to say,
even a claim as old as 30 or 40 years can be filed today, since
limitation petition is not at all applicable as held by Supreme Court in
[Dhannalals case]. So far as appeals are concerned, there is a time
limit of 90 days and if not filed in time, application can be taken out
for condonation of delay.</p>
<p>As for SLP to Supreme Court under Article 136 of Constitution of India,
if no leave was sought for or obtained before High Court, it would be 90
days and if sought for before the High Court and if it was granted or
rejected, it would be 60 days of the order of High Court. As for the
territorial jurisdiction, claimants can now file the claims at a place
they reside and not necessarily where the accident had taken place as it
used to be. But courts deprecate the practice of ‗forum shopping&rsquo;, i.e.
the claimants picking and choosing a court of their choice, by producing
a false address. Some courts in the States insist upon proof of
residence to accept the place of ‗ordinary residence&rsquo; to entertain the
claims.</p>
<h2 id="b-revival-of-old-claims">b) Revival of old claims</h2>
<p>Their needs to be a rider to the well
accepted proposition that there was no period of limitation for such
claims. The rider shall be that it shall be so except in respect of
those cases which had become time-barred by 14/11/1994. This ought to be
so since the amending Act 1994 has not provided for ‗revival of cause of
action‟ even for time-barred ones. The decisions adverted to [(National
Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Singaram S. Abdul Jabher) 1997 (1) LW 209] do
disclose a need for such a revival clause. Except for this caveat, a
limitless period of limitation has been a veritable boon for redressal
of grievances of victims. It is true that the insurers may be
defenceless in relation to claims which may be a decade old or more.
Records may not be available at all. In case the revival aspect is taken
care of, even this minor grievance would be taken care of. Since as of
14/11/94, there is no ambiguity about the removal of period of
limitation, in respect of accidents occurring thereafter, and hence no
insurer or transport corporation can complain, about any delay, as they
are required to organise themselves in conformity with the changed legal
position.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Vigilance by Insurers - Key to protect Fraudulent Claims</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>In the context of this aspect of period of limitation and territorial
jurisdiction, insurers have a lot to worry. The key is to centralise the
claim module so that any claim generated anywhere in India is notified
by the policy issuing office to the office handling the claim, lest
there was duplication of claims. It is possible also that in case of
involvement of two vehicles, the same claimant may cleverly lodge a EC
claim against his employer / insured / insurer in a given court and then
go ahead and lodge a Motor accident claim against the colliding vehicle
/ other insurer in another place in MACT. Insurers verify such aspects.
The two claims may be against two different insurers and unless
investigated and verified, may escape the eye of both insurers. Further,
there may be claims lodged by rival claimants in two different States,
and unless collated and correlated, may be independently contested as
well. Further, in the absence of any period of limitation, vigilance is
the key. 352</p>
<p>If the insurer was liable to a limited number of claims, they must take
this defence and ensure that future claims are suitably avoided. a) Pay
and recover Supreme Courts discretion and does not amount to binding
decision One important development of noteworthy significance is the
repeated directions to insurers to pay and recover from the insured.
Further in the context of absence of driving licence or absence of
endorsement to drive the vehicle, Supreme Court in [Swaran Singh in
2004 ACJ 1 (SC)] chose to hold that insurers cannot avoid liability,
unless the breach by the insured was deliberate, willful and intentional
and the cause of accident also was traceable to the absence of such
driving licence, the remedy for insurers would be to pay and recover. In
cases where the driving licences were fake or fabricated, Supreme Court
invoked the discretionary power vested with them alone under Article 136
and 142 of Constitution of India to permit the victims to receive the
compensation from insurers and insurers being given the right to recover
from the insured. If the insurer was held not liable, the courts should
exonerate them and cannot follow the example of the Supreme Court in
directing payment and recovery power which only the Supreme Court had,
as now held in [2008 (2) LW 19 (SC)].</p>
<h2 id="b-pay-and-recover-for-victims-on-the-road-only">b) Pay and recover for victims on the road only</h2>
<p>Supreme Court has clarified that in the absence of
driving licence per se, the insurer cannot be asked to pay and recover.
If the insured had done his homework and checked the competency of the
driver, than the driving licence turned out to be fake, cannot be held
to be a breach by him. The insurer was liable to indemnify the insured
owner, following the verdict of the apex court. If the victim was a
passenger on the insured vehicle, then too insurer cannot be asked to
pay. Only if the victim was third party, namely a person on the road and
outside the vehicle, such direction to pay and recover can be applied.
Further, it is also now accepted that such right of recovery, whenever
granted, can be executed before the Tribunal and there is no need for
the insurer to pursue a separate civil suit for recovery as held in
Lehru, Kamla, and Kusum and so on. But, in a case where the insurer had
failed to plead no insurance, and adduce evidence and was held liable to
meet the claim, in the absence of pleading and evidence, they can always
obtain the right to pursue the remedy of recovery from the insured, for
which only a Civil suit can be laid and it cannot be before the Tribunal
itself.</p>
<p>There have to be independent proceedings, since the insurer failed to
prove their case before the Tribunal. But for such exceptions, the right
of recovery can be executed, before the Tribunal by the insurer. In fact
apart from the power to execute before the Tribunal, in (Anjana Shyam
case) the Supreme Court has even granted the right to insurers, to seek
the remedy of attachment, before the judgment as per Order 38 Rule 5 of
CPC in appropriate cases, to protect their interest in pending claims
and before the award itself. Where the insurer sought to stall the
disbursement of the awarded sum to claimant, pending security to be
furnished by the owner of the vehicle - writ petition also filed.
Insurer cannot stall payment to claimant for inter se dispute between
insurer and insured. [2007 (4) ACC 77 (Kant)]</p>

<p>Claims for compensation for liability under the Motor
vehicles Act arise out of negligence and fall under the . I. Law of
negligence II. Law of torts III. Law of liability IV. None of the above</p>
<h2 id="e-alternate-methods-of-settlement">E. Alternate Methods of Settlement</h2>
<p>Conciliatory or negotiated
settlements of the legal claims are always beneficial to the insurers.
It is a means for fast disposal of cases which helps not only the
insurance company in expeditious determination of liability but also
helps the claimants to get reasonable amount of compensation without
waiting endlessly to obtain an award. The fast disposal also helps the
MACT to reduce their pendency of cases, to facilitate speedy justice by
saving time wasted in unwanted complex procedures of the courts. The
quicker disposal of cases through conciliation is appreciated as a
positive sign of the insurance companies&rsquo; willingness to help the
victims of motor accidents, which is the moving spirit behind the
enactment of MV Act 1988 by the legislatures. The fast disposal of
claims also enhances the image of the insurance company in the public
eye. The settlement so achieved, is highly economical to the insurance
company. Fast disposal eliminates the adverse impact of inflationary
trends and depreciation in value of money and the resultant increase in
the amount of awards. In India inflation rate is very high, and it
varies from time to time, based on various factors. If we take a
long-term view, we can consider the average of inflation @ 7.5% as a
very conservative estimation of the inflation.</p>
<p>This inflation results in depreciation of money value in actual terms
and we keep adjusting to such inflationary pressure and depreciation in
money value, as time passes. Similarly, any compensation amount that we
think reasonable today will appear to be a paltry sum after 10 years.
This is due to the operation of invisible pressure or attunement of our
mind to the inflationary trends and may also be in response to the
constant changes in the economic condition of the citizens of our
country.</p>
<p>Example If we work out an example at the rate of an assumed inflation of
7.5% per annum &amp; 9-12% per annum interest, an amount of Rs. 1,00,000/-
ten years ago will push the total out go to Rs. 4,53,420/- if we allowed
the case to be awarded by the MACT. However, Rs. 1,00,000/- paid as out
of Court settlement ten years ago, invested to earn interest / dividends
the total income at 10% compound interest the totals corpus (Principal +
Interest) would work out to Rs. 2,59,370/-. There still would be a net
loss of Rs. 1,94,050/- (Rs. 4,53,420 &ndash; Rs. 2,59,370). Therefore, if
claims are settled through alternate methods of settlement, insurers
tend to save by way of reduced claims out go and ultimately make better
contribution to society at large.</p>

Alternate methods of settlement</p>
<p>I<img src="/images/ic-motor/Third_party_Liability_insurance_81.png" alt="targets"></p>
<p>To dispose of Motor TP Claims and Claims under Jald Rahat Yojana (JRY)
through Compromise, the concept of Conciliatory Committee, as an
alternative forum have been introduced u/s 152 of the Motor Vehicle Act
1988, as amended in 1994. The conciliatory committee is required to have
a retired High Court Judge or District Judge, an insurance executive
(Manager / DGM / GM / CMD of GIPSA Companies) and an Orthopedic Surgeon.
The Conciliatory Committee would process an application for compensation
as per legal advices of the panel Advocate and in terms of (as a guide
line) the provision of the Structured Compensation u/s 163A of MV Act
1988, as amended in 1994, for settlement of TP claims between the
insurer and the insured persons. The JRY Scheme has been introduced by
the General Insurance Corporation of India for settlement of non-fatal
claims involving non-minor injuries, at the prelitigation stage. The
Conciliatory Committee is required to process applications for claims
under JRY as per legal advice of the panel advocate and on the basis of
the opinion of an Orthopaedic Surgeon advising the percentage of the
disability sustained by the victim / applicant to recommend to the
competent authority for the approval of the claim. Since the settlement
is effected at the pre-litigation stage and without involving the Court,
no consent award is necessary. But a disadvantage of JRY is that the
claimants may again move Tribunals if they feel that the amount passed
by the Conciliatory Committees under JRY is inadequate. Therefore, the
very purpose of avoiding the legal procedure may be frustrated and the
company will not only have to pay the amount given by the committee
under JRY but also satisfy the award passed by the Tribunal. However, in
order to avoid this situation, we can take shelter u/s 22C (1) of the
Legal Services Authorities (Amendment) Act, 2002, which states any party
to a dispute may, before the dispute is brought before any Court, make
an application to the permanent Lok Adalat for the settlement of
dispute. Therefore, if our primary liability is established through

<li>Lok Adalat</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Since April
1985, Lok Adalat have been exclusively organised for settlement of motor
third party claims. Although the concept of Lok Adalat was very much in
vogue since early years, this forum was made available for settlement of
motor third party claims under the initiative of former Chief Justice of
India, Shri P.N. Bhagwati. Since then number of Lok Adalats have been
organised throughout the country and number of claims have been settled
through this forum to the satisfaction of the claimants. 360</p>
<p>It is expected to gather further momentum for settlement of these claims
through this media as both claimants and the insurance companies get
benefit out of it. Guidelines for placing the motor third party claims
before Lok Adalat</p>
<h2 id="a-organisation-of-lok-adalat-session">a) Organisation of Lok Adalat session</h2>
<p>Generally State&rsquo;s Legal Aid Boards or District Legal Aid Committees organise Lok
Adalat sessions at different places. An initiative may be taken by the
Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) or the insurance companies also to
organise Lok Adalats though it is necessary to organise Lok Adalats
through Legal Aid Boards.</p>
<h2 id="b-participants-in-lok-adalat">b) Participants in Lok Adalat</h2>
<p>The claimants along with their advocates and insurance company and their advocates
participate in arriving at settlement of claims. The panel of Lok Adalat
comprised of Retired High Court Judge / Retired Judge and other eminent
persons, so constituted to arrive at compromise settlement. When both
the parties namely the claimant and insurance company, agree to the
suggested amount, the claim is considered as settled and agreement forms
are signed by both the parties as token of having accepted the
settlement through compromise.</p>
<h2 id="c-procedure-for-placement-of-third-party-claims-before-lok-adalat">c) Procedure for placement of Third Party Claims before Lok Adalat</h2>
<p>As a procedure, state organising body, namely
either State Legal Aid Board or the District Legal Aid Committee, calls
for a statement listing therein the claims which the insurance companies
propose to place before Lok Adalat session. MACT may also forward
pending claims with them for disposal before Lok Adalat. Claimants or
their advocates may sometimes suggest to the Legal Aid Boards to place
their claims before Lok Adalat. However, whenever claims are referred to
the organising body by the agencies other than the insurance company,
list of such claims is forwarded to the insurance companies for their
concurrence to place those cases for settlement in Lok Adalat.</p>
<h2 id="d-parameters-for-placing-of-claims">d) Parameters for placing of claims</h2>
<p>Companies place the claims normally
falling parameters, before Lok Adalat:</p>
<p>within</p>
<p>the following</p>
<p>i. Where occurrence of the accident is within the policy period. ii.
Where estimated liability for compensation is expected to be within the
financial Authority of regional in-charge.</p>
<p>iii. Where no substantial point of law is involved. iv. Where no
defenses are available under Section 149(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act,
1988, such as driver not holding effective driving licence and breach of
policy condition relating to limitations as to use. v. Where Police
Record shows that the driver was holding effective driving licence. vi.
Where despite concerted efforts on the part of the insurance companies
they are not in a position to prove conclusively to the satisfaction of
the court that the vehicle was driven by a person not duly licensed.
vii. Since there is a provision of automatic transfer of insurance in
pursuance of Section 157 of MV Act 1988, the companies cannot take
defence of non-transfer of insurance of the vehicle on their books.
Hence such claims may be placed before Lok Adalat for disposal. viii.
Where more than one vehicle insured with different insurance companies,
is involved in an accident resulting into a third party claim, companies
may place such claims before Lok Adalat pending for deciding the degree
of blame attributable for causing the accident so as to apportion the
liability by the tribunals. In such cases the companies may agree for
settlement on 50-50 basis. ix. As the present Motor Tariff covers
liability in respect of owner or his representative when travelling in
the goods carrying vehicle with his own goods without payment of
additional premium, the companies may place the claims for compensation
in respect of such owners before Lok Adalat. Insurance Companies do not
accept conditional settlement such as subject to verification of certain
documents, production of documents etc. On having reached the agreement
for compromise settlement, concerned MACT issues a Consent Order
specifying inter alia the period during which the agreed amount should
be deposited. On receipt of such Consent Order, companies are required
to deposit the amount as agreed to with the MACT, within 30 days from
the date of award as per statute. Otherwise, MACT are inclined to impose
interest to the agreed settlement. The payment of interest on compromise
settlement would defeat the very purpose in deciding the amount in the
Lok Adalat. The company generally takes immediate steps to deposit the
amount and it is felt that there are no reasons for delay in depositing
the amount once the same is agreed in the Lok Adalat. The statutory
obligation has already been cast on insurance companies to deposit the
amount within the period of 30 days from the date of award. 362</p>
<h2 id="e-lok-adalats-for-pending-claims-at-high-court--supreme-court">e) Lok Adalats for pending claims at High Court / Supreme Court</h2>
<p>In the
event of Lok Adalat for pending appeals before High Court / Supreme
Court is organised, such compensation MACT claims where quantum of
compensation is in dispute may be considered. The appeals which are
filed to decide the point of law need not be considered for placing
before Lok Adalat. The second National Lok Adalat is scheduled on April
12th 2014.</p>
<h2 id="f-claims-for-employees-liability-covered-under-motor-insurance">f) Claims for Employees liability covered under Motor Insurance</h2>
<p>Applications for compensation filed by the paid employees may
also be placed before Lok Adalat, whether wider legal liability is
covered or not. In case wider legal liability is not covered under the
Motor Policy, compromise settlement of such claims before Lok Adalat may
be accepted provided the quantum of compensation is at par with the
compensation payable under the Employee Compensation Act, 1923 and is
acceptable to the claimant.</p>

<h2 id="f-principles-of-damages">F. Principles of Damages</h2>
<ol>
<li>Principles governing determination of Compensation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>A man is not compensated for the physical injury. He is
compensated for the loss, which he suffers as a result of that injury.
There is no compensation available for sentimental agony, no damages for
hearts anguish, and no financial assistance for mental tribulations. The
compensation amount should be commensurate with the injuries sustained
and the sufferings undergone by the injured claimant. Bodily injury is
to be treated as deprivation, which entitles a claimant to damages and
the amounts of damages vary according to the gravity of the injury and
degree and duration of deprivation. Three basic principles governing
determination of compensation in injury disablement claims: i. Principle
of Assessability ii. Principle of Uniformity iii. Principle of
Predictability a) Principle of Assessability In case of grave injury,
where the body or the brain suffers massive impairment, it is difficult
to assess fair compensation in terms of money. The principle of
assessability envisages that the award must basically be a „conventional
figure‟ derived from experience and from awards pronounced in similar
cases, to ensure some measure of uniformity in awards. b) Principle of
Uniformity The principle of uniformity is of utmost importance in
administration of justice so that similar cases are decided uniformly;
otherwise, there will be criticism and dissatisfaction in general
community and a grievance for causing discrimination. The uniformity in
award requires each case to be weighed upon its own individual merit.
Since no two cases are alike, awards in comparable cases do enable the
Court to seek guidance, not by referring to a particular case and
treating it as a precedent, but by looking at general level of damages
in similar cases, which would offer predictability by means of
comparison of such cases by analogy. c) Principle of predictability The
injured parties should be able to predict with some measure of accuracy,
the sum that is likely to be awarded in a particular case, as per the
basic principle of predictability in assessment of compensation. The
amount of compensation should neither be inadequate nor token. IC-72
MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>However, it may be noted that sympathy for the claimant should not be
allowed to affect the calculation of damages. The ratio of judicial
compensation hinges on the pivotal issues of: i. Reasonable compensation
i . Uniformity in approach ii. . Assessment with moderation The award
should neither be punitive or exemplary nor extravagant or oppressive.
While assessing damages, the Court excludes all considerations, which
rest in speculation or fancy, though conjecture to some extent is
inevitable.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Quantification of Compensation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The standard for
quantification of compensation must be an objective standard. The
following items / heads in personal injury claims are awarded: i.</p>
<p>Shock, pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life.</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Injury itself, depending upon the disability, whether permanent,
temporary, partial or complete.</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Medical and incidental expenses</p>
<p>iv. Loss of income till the date of petition and from the date of
petition till the date of award and future loss. v. Loss of earning
capacity, having bearing on above. vi. Shortened life expectancy. vi. .
Loss of prospects of marriage, avocation, education, social, economic
and cultural opportunities. vii. . Loss of beauty due to disfiguration.
ix. Disability, physical, mental and social. x. Medical treatment
towards future treatment, if any. xi. Any other depending upon the facts
and circumstances of the case in case of motor accident compensation
claims, award is of two types, special compensation and general
compensation.</p>
<h2 id="3-kinds-of-damages">3. Kinds of Damages</h2>
<p>Definition Pecuniary damages: These damages (also known as special
damages) are generally designed to make good the pecuniary loss, which
is capable of being calculated in terms of money. Non-pecuniary damages:
Those damages which are incapable of being assessed by arithmetical
calculation. The High Court of Gujarat considered the principles laid
down in (Davies and Nance case) and explained the law to be applied for
ascertaining the damages in such cases</p>
<h2 id="a-pecuniary-damages-special-damages">a) Pecuniary Damages (Special Damages)</h2>
<p>Pecuniary damages are also called special damage or special
compensation. These relate to actual financial loss or expenses
resulting from accident e.g., medical, surgical and hospital expenses.
These damages are to be specifically proved and have to be supported by
bills and vouchers. The special damages include the following: i.
Expenses incurred by the claimant in respect of injury, which may
include medical expenses, special diet, and cost of nursing or attendant
including loss of earning, or profit up to the date of trial. i.</p>
<p>. Loss of earning capacity may include incapacity to earn in future and
also incapacity in the labour market, loss on account of termination of
service or discontinuance of any trade, business or profession.</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Any other material loss, which may require any special treatment or
aid to the injured for the rest of his life.</p>
<h2 id="b-non-pecuniary-damages-general-damages">b) Non-Pecuniary Damages (General Damages)</h2>
<p>Non-pecuniary or general
damages are those, which the law presumes to flow from the negligence.
These general damages are awarded as monetary compensation for pain and
suffering, mental and nervous shock, loss of amenities of life,
continued impairment of health, loss of prospective earnings, loss of
matrimonial prospects in case of disfigurement etc.: i. Damages for
mental and physical shock, pain and suffering either already suffered by
the claimant or likely to suffer in future. Damages are given for both
mental and physical pain and suffering.</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life. It results
when the injured is deprived of ordinary experiences and enjoyment of
life. e.g., claimant may not be able to sit, walk, run or loss of
marriage prospects, loss of conjugal happiness etc.</p>
<p>i.. Damages for loss of expectation of life: when the injury leads to
shortening of normal expectation of life e.g., longevity of the affected
person on account of injury.</p>
<p>iv. Other inconvenience, hardship, discomfiture and mental stress in
life There is a consensus on judicial precedents that when general
damages are quantified, the status of a claimant in his life acquires
significance. But it is the injury sustained by the claimant, which are
material and not his status in life. The injury will cause the same
pain, suffering and agony to the sufferer irrespective of the fact
whether he is a pauper or prince, young or old. There is neither a
quantitative scale nor any mathematical formula, by which damages for
pain, sufferings, loss of amenities of life and injury to health can be
quantified in terms of money. 4. Assessment of Compensation Assessment
of compensation depends on the following features: i.</p>
<p>Nature of injuries</p>
<p>i . Status of person ii. . Effect of injuries on the person in future
iv. Mental and physical pain that the injured has suffered v. The age of
the injured vi. Replacement of limb vi. . Nature of medical treatment
vii. . The general effect on health and efficiency ix. The effect on
marriage prospects x. Loss of earnings and other allied matters</p>
<h2 id="a-disability-in-non-fatal-accidents">a) Disability in Non-fatal Accidents</h2>
<p>In disability cases, the
compensation is awarded to the victim for personal as well as economic
loss suffered by him. The damages for personal loss will include general
damages for pain and suffering, as well as loss of amenities of life.
Bodily injury is to be treated as a deprivation, which entitles a
plaintiff to damages and (that) the amount of damages varies according
to the gravity of injury. Deprivation may bring with it three
consequences: i.</p>
<p>Personal suffering and loss of enjoyment of life;</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. Actual pecuniary loss resulting into an expense reasonably incurred by
the plaintiff; and</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. The probable future loss of income by reason of incapacity or
diminished capacity for work</p>
<p>It was further held that the principle of restitution in integrum i.e.,
placing in original financial position was unattainable as a perfect
compensation, but the damages are to be assessed on a fair valuation
standard on this head.</p>
<h2 id="b-basis-for-loss-of-earning-capacity">b) Basis for loss of earning capacity</h2>
<p>In order to
prove the nature of injuries sustained and the alleged loss of earning
capacity a Doctor indicates: i.</p>
<p>Percentage of permanent and temporary disablement,</p>
<p>i . Functional disability and Loss of earning capacity : it is not a
substitute for percentage of the physical disablement. It is one of the
factors taken into account. There is no set method for assessing
compensation in disability for actual assessment. In [Vinod Kumar vs.
Ved Mitra] MP High Court formulated certain rules in this regard to
bring a measure of predictability to the awards given by the Courts. The
three factors are to be looked into while determining award: i.</p>
<p>The amount of compensation awarded must be reasonable and must be
assessed with moderation;</p>
<p>i.. Regard must be had to awards made in comparable cases; and</p>
<p>i.. The sums awarded should to a considerable extent be conventional</p>
<h2 id="c-disability-in-non-fatal-accidents-for-non--earning-persons">c) Disability in non-fatal accidents for non- earning persons</h2>
<p>Following compensation amounts are recommended under Motor Vehicle (Amendment)
Bill 2007 in case of disability to the victim arising out of nonfatal
accident. A Loss of income, if any, for actual period of disablement not
exceeding fifty-two weeks plus either of the following subject to
maximum of Rs. 10.00 lakhs for disability in non-fatal accidents in
cases other than non-earning persons. i. In case of permanent total
disablement the amount payable shall be arrived at by multiplying the
annual loss of income by the appropriate Multiplier applicable to the
age of the victim on the date of determining the compensation. i . In
case of Permanent Partial Disablement, the amount of compensation
payable shall be arrived at by multiplying the compensation payable in
case of permanent total disablement as specified under item (i) above by
the percentage of loss of earning capacity caused by that injury. For
injuries deemed to result in permanent total disablement / permanent
partial disablement as per Section 145 (h), the percentage of loss of
earning capacity shall be as per Schedule I of the Employee&rsquo;s
Compensation Act, 1923. d) General damages in case of disability in
non-fatal accidents as proposed in Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill 2007
i.</p>
<p>Pain and suffering Non-grievous injury up to Rs. 5,000</p>
<p>i . Pain and suffering Grievous injury upto Rs. 20,000 ii. . Medical

<h2 id="5-assessment-of-injury-claims">5. Assessment of Injury Claims</h2>
<p>No two persons suffering even similar
injuries can attract the same or similar compensation. The heads under
which compensation can be computed are truly astounding. The scope for
awarding general damages as opposed to special damages is too wide to be
fully spelt out. While it is true, that it is a settled law that
compensation in injury claims can attract a higher award than even in
cases of death, for the reason that the injured has to endure the
disability for the rest of his life. In practical terms it is found that
the discretion vested in assessment is abused and on top of it the
evidence adduced in support of injuries is fabricated.</p>
<h2 id="a-permanent-disability">a) Permanent Disability</h2>
<p>It was from 1/10/82 that ‗No Fault liability'
under Section 92-A was introduced in MV Act 1939. The expression
permanent disablement was used in the statute itself. Any impairment of
the functioning of the limbs or parts of body or disfiguration of the
face would leave behind a permanent disablement. But the language is
couched in generic terms and it has, therefore, led to varying
interpretations. What appears to have become the norm or accepted
standard is that irrespective of the nature of a fracture, it is treated
as permanent disablement attracting the minimum compensation under ‗No
Fault Liability&rsquo;. It is time there was an institutional mechanism
introduced in the statute itself for the assessment of permanent
disablement, even if the discretion to assess compensation thereupon
rested with the Tribunals.</p>
<h2 id="b-evidence-of-permanent-disablement-and-just-compensation">b) Evidence of Permanent Disablement and Just compensation</h2>
<p>The evidence of permanent disablement has become a vexed
issue. Ultimately, the Courts are seeking to award Just compensation.
For the sake of consistency and uniformity the notification issued by
Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment dated 1/6/2001 must be
applied in the assessment of permanent disability suffered by victims.
Guidelines have been drawn under it which if applied would make sure
that evidence of disablement was genuine and true. The fabrication and
falsification or padding of evidence may be minimal. The person imposed
with the obligation to pay compensation would also be aware of it.
Leaving it to the whim and fancy of such stock witnesses has rendered
this jurisdiction liable to misuse and abuse.</p>

itself is called for. Such provision could be to the effect that
assessment of disability shall be as per the stated guidelines and such
assessment shall be only through a Medical Board constituted in each
District The injured ought to appear as a matter of rule before such
Medical Boards and produce the certificate of assessment of disability
before the Tribunals, and the assessment of disability shall be held
binding on the Tribunals without need for examination of the Medical
Board so constituted.</p>
<p>This would save a lot of time and ensure speedier disposal of claims
also. More importantly, it would usher in an era of consistency and
uniformity and also introduce an element of bona fide in the assessment
of disability, which is thoroughly lacking as on date. A provision for
application of the guidelines mentioned above and reference to Medical
Board for assessment of permanent disability with the certificate to
this effect issued by the latter constituting binding proof of it, need
be introduced. Such statutory mandate will rid the system of all the
pernicious practices now prevalent due to the role play of stock
witnesses/medical men.</p>
<h2 id="a-insurers-right-to-examine">a) Insurer‟s Right to Examine</h2>
<p>the Injured The
Insurance Companies and Transport Corporations did not care to adduce
contra evidence on alleged disablement and therefore, the assessments of
stock witnesses of claimants were becoming a fait accompli. But then
when an insurer sought to refer the claimant for such examination for
rebuttal evidence through their expert, the plea was rejected by the
Madras High Court as unfounded. It was ruled that it would suffice for
the insurer to cross examine the medical expert of the claimant and
there was no necessity for the insurer to compel the injured to appear
before their expert [(R. James vs. National Insurance Company Limited)
2004 ACJ 918]. This view requires reconsideration by the court in the
light of the malpractices prevalent in this area. When a claimant seeks
compensation from a respondent then the respondent has every right to
examine the injured to verify the truth and bona fides of the claim.
Mere crossexamination of a stock witness would get them nowhere. By
examination through their nominated expert or even through Medical Board
the evidence of the stock witness can be shown up for what it was.
Further, as the person being forced to pay compensation, the paymaster
had a legal right to seek verification of the nature of injuries and
possible disablement. The insurer must exercise such right and if
refused should take it up to the Apex Court to test the correctness of
the denial of such relief.</p>
<h2 id="b-loss-of-earning-capacity-vis-a-vis-loss-of-earning-power">b) Loss of Earning Capacity vis-a-vis Loss of Earning Power</h2>
<p>This is another vexed question as a component in the
assessment of compensation in injury claims under the head of award
under permanent disablement. The injured, so disabled, may suffer a
direct impact on earning capacity. For such consequence of disablement,
a separate and distinct sum may be called for as loss of earning power.
It is settled law that the two heads are distinct and separate. In
[(Ramesh Chandra Vs. Randhir Singh) 1990 (3) SCC 723] the Supreme
Court had affirmed the distinct status of the two heads.</p>
<p>In [(MD, Thiruvallur Transport Corpn., Vs. Thangavelu )1995 (2) LW
685], it pointed out that permanent disability was the cause and the
effect was loss of earning power. Hence separate sums would have to be
granted thereupon. Way back in [(MD, Thiruvalur Transport Corpn., Vs.
M. Janardhanam) 1987 ACJ 233] itself it was pointed out that
compensation could be computed in proportion to the disability assessed.
Now in the Second Schedule there is a reference to such computation.</p>
<h2 id="c-padding-up-the-claims-for-permanent-disability-through-multiplier-method">c) Padding up the Claims for Permanent Disability through Multiplier method</h2>
<p>The practice of assessment of compensation in proportion to the
disability assessed, has led to the regrettable practice of padding up
the claims for permanent disability. The multiplier method is being
adopted indiscriminately in assessing compensation under this head. The
Courts fix the earnings mechanically as per evidence and the multiplier
as per age, and loss of earning power is computed in proportion to the
assessed physical disability adopting the multiplier method. This has
led to bloated awards disproportionate to the actual facts. In [(United
India Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Veluchamy) - 2005 ACJ 1483: 2005 (1) CTC
38] the Madras High Court had occasion to consider this aspect: ―That
the multiplier method ought not to be applied indiscriminately assuming
that in every case of disablement suffered there must be a corresponding
award for loss of earning power in proportion to the assessed
disablement. There must be credible evidence to support an award.
Further, even while considering a sum under than this head, it was ruled
that multiplier has to be much less than the schedule figure and the
earnings too should be discounted for assessment. But the unfortunate
reality is that instead of appreciating this decision for what it was,
this decision is being seen as vindication for assessment of
compensation in injury claims adopting the multiplier method.</p>
<h2 id="d-general-damages-for-death-cases">d) General Damages for Death Cases</h2>
<p>The compensation in fatal accident cases is
assessed under: i. Pecuniary loss of maintenance to the dependents
i.. Loss of savings to the estate of the deceased including</p>
<p>i.. damages for pain &amp; suffering, loss of expectation of life to the
deceased</p>
<p>The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 enlarges the scope of legal representatives
who can initiate action or suit. The fatal cases involve claims in
respect of: i. Special damages up to the date of death</p>
<p>i.. Funeral expenses</p>
<p>i.. General damages for the pain and suffering up to the date of death</p>

<ol start="7">
<li>Quantum and the Concept of Justness</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Section 168 of MV Act, 1988
envisages ‗Just Compensation&rsquo;. The word quantum is incapable of any
precise definition. Justness would depend upon the facts and
circumstances of each case. The Supreme Court had ruled that assessment
of compensation should be liberal not niggardly [(Concord of India
Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Nirmala Devi) 1980 ACJ 55]. It was also ruled
that Justness was not related to the claim made, but in terms of the
evidence adduced and assessment made by Court. This meant that awards in
excess of the claim could also he made [(Nagappa vs. Gurudayal Singh)
2003 ACJ 12 (SC)]. While it was held that award should be liberal not
niggardly, it has also been held that it ought not to be a bonanza as
well. A middle path must be struck in the search for Justness. It is an
admitted position of law that there is no one formula for assessment.
Inevitably therefore an element of guesswork or estimation enters the
arena [(Ashwani Kumar Mishra vs. Muniam Babu) AIR 1999 SC 2260]. But
such guesswork or estimation should not be based on conjecture,
speculation or whim or fancy. It should be grounded in reality and
relatable as a fact.</p>
<h2 id="8-selection-of-multiplier">8. Selection of Multiplier</h2>
<p>Admittedly, there is no one straitjacket
formula for assessment. But the introduction of the Second Schedule and
multiplier factor meant that there was scope for an element of
uniformity or consistency at least with regard to the multiplier to be
adopted. However, the Second Schedule brought into force from 14/11/2004
was replete with arithmetical errors [(Uttar Pradesh State Transport
Corpn., vs. Trilok Chandra) 1996 ACJ 831 (SC)] notwithstanding such
mistakes; it is now settled law that reference to the Schedule to fix
the multiplier is the rule. As for multiplier as a concept of
application, it is now accepted that it is the most scientific and
refined system which has stood the test of time. But in the choice of
multipliers, there are again varying decisions. In Trilok Chandra case
supra while referring to the anomalies, it was pointed out that in a
case where the deceased was a bachelor, the multiplier cannot be related
to age of the victim but shall be related to the age of the dependents.</p>
<h2 id="a-fatal-claims-rule-of-thumb">a) Fatal Claims Rule of Thumb</h2>
<p>However, as for the choice of the
multiplier, the Schedule shall only be a guide and not a ready reckoner.
Though there is restriction on the maximum multiplier permissible at 18,
there was discretion vested with the courts in choosing it. The Court
can consider the ages of the victim, claimants, longevity in the family
etc. and arrive at an appropriate multiplier. For a 50 year old,
notwithstanding superannuation, a multiplier of 15 was fixed. The
Supreme Court ruled that multiplier need not be as per Schedule
[(United India Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Patricia Jean Mahajan) - 2002
ACJ 1441]. In a case where the deceased was a foreign citizen and his
earnings, say, in USA were substantial, assessment of compensation
payable in India has to necessarily take note of the Indian economic and
social conditions. The compensation payable shall have to take note of
the differing economic conditions in the countries and accordingly
reduce the multiplier to lesser than the Schedule figure. Thus, it would
appear that in the choice of multiplier, the Courts are not duty bound
to fix it as per Schedule figure alone to a tee.</p>
<p>Important The Court has the discretion to adopt a suitable multiplier,
be it higher than the schedule or lesser than it, for good and valid
reasons, but shall, however, not exceed 18 at the maximum.</p>
<p>The age of the victim or dependents and the earnings of the deceased
would be relevant factors for consideration. It will all be a matter of
evaluating the evidence adduced by the claimants. The multiplier shall
be chosen in conformity with the age of the victim, claimants and due
regard to longevity in the family. As for the multiplicand it would be
in relation to the proven earnings of the deceased. On introduction of
the Second Schedule the concept of notional income came into being. As
per Second Schedule it was pegged at Rs. 15,000/- p.a. as on 14/11/94.
The Courts appear to go by: i. i. i.</p>
<p>Cost of living, . Number of dependents, . Nature of avocation and so on</p>
<p>In fact the Supreme Court has pointed out that the notional income fixed
way back in 1994 [(Deepal Girishbai Sonis case) - 2004 ACJ 934] may
require an upward revision with due regard to increased cost of living.</p>
<h2 id="b-net-pay-concept">b) Net Pay Concept</h2>
<p>One significant development was with regard to the
―net pay concept‖ introduced by the Supreme Court in [(Asha Vs. United
India Insurance Co. Ltd.) - 2004 ACJ 448]. From and out of the gross
pay if there are deductions, then the nature of deductions have to be
examined. The deductions could be investments or savings of the deceased
and, therefore, eschewing them from the zone of consideration would be
unjust and improper. It is a fact of life that in many a case the
employee may have provided for the rainy day and suffered deductions by
way of LIC premium, Housing Loan advance, Public provident Fund
contributions etc. These constitute savings of the deceased and treating
the net pay would be unfair to the claimants. In effect, the fervent
plea would be to apply [(Asha Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd.]
case supra, in proper perspective with due regard to the nature of
deductions and thereby arrive at a meaningful net pay for dependency
rather than mechanically going by the numbers.</p>
<h2 id="c-future-increase-in-income">c) Future Increase in Income</h2>
<p>While fixing the dependency of the deceased, the Courts have to
examine the income of the deceased. But while fixing such income as on
date of death, there are a number of decisions suggesting that the
income should not be as on date of accident / death. The Courts have to
bear in mind the nature of vocation or employment, scope for increased
earnings from proportion etc. and also the inflationary impact on the
Rupee and duly project the earnings and fix the dependency thereafter.
Such a ready and roughshod method may not always be correct in
application.</p>
<p>The Court should have before it the evidence regarding future prospects
of increase of income in the course of employment or business or
profession, as the case may be. That is what has now been clarified in
the recent judgment of the Supreme Court reported in [(Bijoy Kumar
Dugar Vs. Bidyadhar Dutta) 2006 (3) CTC 122] wherein it has been held
that Courts cannot read into the present earnings, projected increases,
without the benefit of actual evidence on record for it. Hence, it would
appear that things may stabilise to the effect that while fixing the
dependency, relevance could be had to future increases in income but it
shall however be based on concrete evidence adduced before the Court and
not on mere conjecture or speculation.</p>
<h2 id="d-property-damage-claims">d) Property Damage Claims</h2>
<p>The assessment of property damage claim is based on cost of repair or cost
of replacement of the property so that it is restored to its original
position. If the property is fully destroyed, the damages would be equal
to the value of the property on the date of loss including reasonable
consequential losses too. If the property is damaged the value will be
cost of repairs subject to depreciation in its value and cost of hiring
alternative property or loss of use or loss of profit earned during the
period of repairs. For example, in case of damage to tiller 10 years
old, application of 50% depreciation may be proper [2008 (1) TN MAC 361
(Mad)]. Loss of income is not sustainable in a property damage claim
[2008 (1) MLJ 640]. Loss of income, Revenue Loss is disallowed [2008
(1) TN MAC 95 (Mad)].</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Award of Rate of Interest</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The Section 171 of 1988 Act empowers tribunal to grant interest from the date of claim at
simple interest at such rates as it deems reasonable. Compensation is an
amount paid in advance for any loss of life or loss of dependency or
loss of earnings. It is not a debt. Therefore, the interest to be
awarded under Section 110 CC of Motor Vehicles Act could only be 6% per
annum. For grant of higher interest sufficient reasons are to be given
by the Claims Tribunal. So far as the higher rate of interest
stipulation is concerned, it is to be noted that grant of interest under
Section 171 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is discretionary. The
purpose for award of interest is to put pressure on the relevant person
not to delay in making the payment and, to compensate the victim or his
dependents at least to some extent for such delay as may occur, by way
of payment of interest.</p>
<p>In determining the quantum of interest awardable under the relevant
Section 171, the Claims Tribunal acting under Section 166 of the 1988
Act can derive direct guidance from Section 34 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908. In fact, the provision requires payment of interest in
addition to compensation already determined. Even though the expression
‗may' is used, a duty is laid on the Claims Tribunal to consider the
question of interest separately with due regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case. The provision is discretionary and is not and
cannot be bound by rules.</p>
<h2 id="a-duty-and-discretion-in-awarding-interest">a) Duty and discretion in awarding interest</h2>
<p>A statutory discretion is not, however, necessarily or, indeed, usually
absolute; it may be qualified by express and implied legal duties to
comply with substantive and procedural requirements before a decision is
taken whether to act and how to act. Moreover, there may be discretion,
whether to exercise a power, but no discretion as to the mode of its
exercise; or a duty to act when certain conditions are present, but
discretion how to act. Discretion may thus be coupled with duties.</p>
<h2 id="b-judicial-discretion-vs-responsibility">b) Judicial Discretion vs. Responsibility</h2>
<p>The word discretion standing
single and unsupported by circumstances signifies exercise of judgment,
skill or wisdom as distinguished from folly, unthinking or haste;
evidently, therefore, discretion cannot be arbitrary but must be a
result of judicial thinking. The word in itself implies vigilant
circumspection and care; therefore, where the legislature concedes
discretion it also imposes a heavy responsibility. If a certain latitude
or liberty is accorded by statute or rules to a judge, as distinguished
from a ministerial or administrative official, in adjudicating on
matters brought before him, it is judicial discretion. It limits and
regulates the exercise of the discretion, and prevents it from being
wholly absolute, capricious, or exempt from review. Such discretion is
usually given on matters of procedure or punishment, or costs of
administration rather than with reference to vested substantive rights.
The matters, which should regulate the exercise of discretion, have been
stated by eminent judges in somewhat different forms of words but with
substantial similarity. When a statute gives judge discretion, what is
meant is a judicial discretion, regulated according to the known rules
of law, and not the mere whim or caprice of the person to whom it is
given on the assumption that he is discreet.</p>
<h2 id="c-no-scope-for-retrospective-enhancement-in-case-of-default">c) No scope for retrospective enhancement in case of default</h2>
<p>Though Section 171 of the 1988 Act confers discretion on the Claims Tribunal to
award interest, the same is meant to be exercised in cases where the
claimant can claim the same as a matter of right. In the light of the
above background, it is to be judged whether the Claims Tribunal can
impose a stipulation for higher rate of interest in case of default.
Once the discretion has been exercised by the Claims Tribunal to award
simple interest on the amount of compensation to be awarded at a
particular rate and from a particular date, there is no scope for
retrospective enhancement for default in payment of compensation. No
express or implied power in this regard can be culled out from Section
171 of the 1988 Act. Such a direction in the award for retrospective
enhancement of interest for default in payment of the compensation
together with interest payable thereon virtually amounts to imposition
of penalty, which is not statutorily envisaged and prescribed. [Appeal
(civil) 399 of 2004 National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Keshav Bahadur and
Ors. date of judgment: 20/01/2004]</p>
<h2 id="d-rate-of-interest-offered-by-nationalised-banks-on-fds--annum">d) Rate of interest offered by Nationalised Banks on FDs / annum</h2>
<p>In [(Kaushuma Begum vs. New India
Assurance) 2001 ACJ 428 (SC)] the Supreme Court observed in Para 23 in
addition to the amount of compensation simple interest shall also be
paid at such rate and from such date not earlier than the date of making
the claim as may be specified in this behalf. Earlier interest @ 12% was
found to be reasonable rate of simple interest, but with a change in
economy and policy of the Reserve Bank of India the interest rate has
been lowered. The Nationalised banks are now granting interest @ 9% on
fixed deposits for one year. We, therefore, direct that the compensation
amount fixed herein before shall bear interest at the rate of 9% per
annum from the date of the claim made by the appellants. The rate of
Interest [2002 (10) ACJ 1814 Karnataka] to be awarded in all motor
accident claims shall normally be the rate of interest offered by
Nationalised Banks on fixed deposits for one year.</p>

<ol>
<li>Limited Defenses available to Insurer</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Parliament had
consciously restricted the defences of the insurer. The insurer may be
prejudiced by such a restricted defence mechanism, but cannot traverse
beyond the permitted defenses under Section 149 (2). Of course, the
benefit of Section 110-C (2A) then and now Section 170 is to contest on
merits by obtaining specific permission of the Court to do so. This rule
of law has stood the test of time [(Shankarayya vs. United India
Insurance Co. Ltd. [AIR 1998 (SC) p 2968], Nicolletta et al )].
Hence, what matters would be the defenses open under Section 149 (2) and
not the terms and conditions under the contract of insurance, until the
courts start appreciating the fact that the insurance companies are not
charitable institutions and are there to protect the contractual
liability taken up by them by virtue of payment of premium by the
insured for the risk of insured.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Changing Approach of the Apex Court</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>A combined reading of the above said legal position, in succinct terms
has meant that insurer&rsquo;s foundational defense on Section 64-VB of
Insurance Act, 1938, has also suffered a dent. Section 64-VB of
Insurance Act, 1938 is an embargo placed on the insurers not to issue
covers without receiving premium in advance. Payment of premium by
cheque is permissible. If the insurer chooses to obtain the cheque and
issues a cover, and if the cheque is dishonoured, the consequences
thereof, cannot befall on the innocent Third Party victim of accident,
as the statutory protection afforded to him in law vide Section 146 MV
Act,1988 would take away the right to claim compensation. Insurer cannot
rely upon Section 64-VB and contend that as consideration for the
contract, a basis required as per the Indian Contract Act, 1872, was not
received; hence there was no valid and enforceable contract against
them.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has negated such a defense and ruled in Sunitha Rathi,
Rula etc. that even if the cheque had been dishonoured, the insurer may
still have to meet the Third Party claim. They would however, be
entitled to proceed against their insured for recovery of the statutory
liability met out by them on the insured behalf. In respect of Third
Party claims the dishonour of the cheque for premium would not be a
valid defense. In respect of OD claims, it would be a valid defense and
the insured cannot enforce his claim (Laxmi Narain Dutts case). However,
the Supreme Court has suggested that if the cancellation of the cover
had taken place prior to occurrence of accident and the insured was put
on notice of such cancellation, then they might be entitled for
avoidance of liability. It appears to be a saving grace for the
insurers. 3. Defenses Available to Insurer The insurer takes up
statutory defenses available and pleads as well as submits evidences to
protect its insured&rsquo;s legal liability as well as statutory liability to
pay and recover due to benevolent nature of legislation. Where there are
no defenses, filing of written statement is of secondary importance and
the insurers should give greater emphasis on settlement of liability
through compromise. a) Pleadings But where defenses are available,
pleadings assume significance, since Claims Tribunals are inclined to
treat the litigation as application for claimants and as civil suit for
opponents. Each and every allegation made in the claims petition should
be dealt with specifically, either by admission or denial. It may be
noted that simply writing „Not admitted‟ in the written statement is no
denial. Further mentioning „No knowledge‟ is worse than ‗Not admitted‟.
No Knowledge si not the denial by implication. Bare denial does not
serve any purpose where an allegation of fact needs to be specifically
denied. The averments in the claim petition, which have not been
specifically denied, have to be accepted as true in the absence of any
circumstances indicating collusion. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal
has evolved as a separate and independent branch, where applicability of
„The Evidence Act‟ to Claims Tribunal has not been accepted as a right
and the same trend still continues. In order to defend Third Party cases
effectively:</p>

written statements are to be carefully studied and redrafted, if
necessary to lead defences by the insurance company.</p>
<h2 id="b-specific-plea">b) Specific Plea</h2>
<p>Specific rules of pleadings as contained in the Code of Civil Procedure,

duty of the panel advocate to see that specific pleas are framed as

<h2 id="5-notice-through-the-court-to-insurer">5. Notice through the Court to Insurer</h2>
<p>Section 149 (2) stipulates that
no sum shall be payable by an insurer under Section 149 (1) in respect
of any judgment or award unless, before the commencement of the
proceedings in which the judgment or award is given, the insurer had
notice through the Court or, as the case may be, the Claims Tribunal of
the bringing of the proceedings, or in respect of such judgment or award
so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal; and an insurer
to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceedings is so given shall
be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any
of the following grounds, namely : (A) That there has been a breach of
specified condition of the policy, it being one of the following
conditions, namely: (a) A condition excluding the use of the vehicle i.</p>
<p>For hire or reward, where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of
insurance, a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward,
or</p>
<p>i.. For organised racing and speed testing, or</p>
<p>i.. For a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is
used, where the vehicle is a transport vehicle, or</p>
<p>iv. Without side-car being attached where the vehicle is a motor cycle;
or (b) A condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by
any person who is not duly licensed, or by any person who has been
disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the
period of disqualification; or (c) A condition excluding liability for
injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war, civil war, riot or
civil commotion, or (B) That the policy was obtained by the
non-disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which
was false in some material particular. If a policy is cancelled and the
Certificate of Insurance is returned to the insurer before the
occurrence of the accident, it was a valid ground of defence in the old
1939 Act, but the same was deleted from the 1988 Act. The Apex courts in
[(Deddappa &amp; Ors Appeal vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd.) (CA) 5829 of
2007 dt.12/12/2007)] has expressed the view that if all concerned have
been informed, mainly RTO and insured, by registered post A. D. &amp; all
the proof made available at the time of the evidence, and if the
contract of insurance has been cancelled, the insurance company would
not be liable to satisfy the claim as held.</p>
<p>a) Insured‟s Collusion vs. Insurers Right to Proceedings The insurance
company can contest the claim preferred before the Claims Tribunal only
on the statutory grounds prescribed under Section 149(2) of the Act,
but, if there is collusion between the petitioner making the claim and
the insured resisting the claim or if the insured against whom the claim
is made has failed to contest the claim, the insurance company can step
in and seek permission of the Claims Tribunal by making a prayer for
getting itself impleaded as a party to the proceeding and the insurer so
impleaded can then contest the proceeding on grounds other than the
grounds enumerated in Section 149 (2) of the 1988 Act. b) Reasoned Order
under Section 170 The insurer&rsquo;s interest is adversely placed due to the
following factors: i.</p>
<p>Primary category: The insured / owner remains ex-parte despite service
of summons.</p>
<p>ii. Second category: Insured / owner never come forward to contest the
claim effectively, even though appearance is made. iii. Third category:
Even after filing of Written Statement on their behalf, neither any
persuasion is done nor are any evidences produced to support the defence
contentions of the insurance company. In such circumstances in the
absence of an application u/s 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act 1988 (as
amended) and for not obtaining of suitable order from the Tribunal, the
insurance company is precluded from contesting the claim on merit or
beyond the grounds stipulated under the statute under Section 149(2) of
the Motor Vehicle Act 1988. The insurance company is precluded from
pursuing appeal before the High Court in the absence of application u/s
170 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 for not obtaining order towards
ineffective participation of the insured. There are several rulings that
without the order of the Claims Tribunal no advantage can be given to
the insurance company to contest the claim on merits of the case.
Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: The section impleads
insurer in certain cases, where in the course of any inquiry the Claims
Tribunal is satisfied that: i.</p>
<p>386</p>
<p>There is collusion between the person making the claim and the person
against whom the claim is made, or</p>
<p>. The person against whom the claim is made has failed to contest the
claim, it may for reasons to be recorded in writing, direct that the
insurer who may be liable in respect of such claim, shall be impleaded
as a party to the proceeding and the insurer so impleaded shall
thereupon have, without prejudice to the provisions contained in Section
149(2), the right to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that
are available to the person against whom the claim has been made.</p>

<h2 id="a-recording-of-fact-is-sufficient-under-section-170">Supreme Court in [(Shankarayya vs. United
India Insurance Co. Ltd) AIR 1998 (SC) p 2968)] decided on 16th Jan
1998 making it mandatory for insurance companies to file an application
under Section 170 in the Lower Court in case they wish to file an appeal
on quantum without the co-operation of the insured. An oral submission
will not do. An application has to be filed by panel advocate in the
MACT under Section 170. The Court may accept or reject the application.
However, this order of the Court should be a written order. A certified
copy of this order should also be obtained, to be filed in High Court in
case appeal is preferred. In case the application under Section 170 is
rejected by the MACT, an appeal should be filed in the High Court
immediately (not after the pronouncement of judgment) for consideration
of the appeal. Appeals filed with delay are not admitted at the High
Court.
a) Recording of fact is sufficient under Section 170</h2>
<p>In [(United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Jyotsnaben Sudhirbhai Patel &amp; Ors)] the
driver and the owner of the offending vehicle appeared before the Claims
Tribunal, but did not file any written statement refuting the
allegations made in the petition. The Claims Tribunal stated that these
respondents did not step into the witness box, to explain the
circumstances and the manner, in which the actual mishap took place. It
was further stated that in view of this, the Claims Tribunal was
compelled to draw an adverse inference against the respondents. This
case arising out of SLP[C] No. 13002 of 2002, appeal under Section 170
before Gujarat High Court was found not maintainable, especially in view
of the observations made by the Supreme Court [(Shankarayya vs. United
India Insurance Co. Ltd.) AIR 1998 SC p 2968] and the appeal preferred
by the appellant was dismissed. The Supreme Court in this case [in
(United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Jyotsnaben Sudhirbhai Patel &amp; Ors)
{Appeal (civil) 6295 of 2003 (Arising out of SLP[C] No. 13002 of 2002)
Date of judgment 11/08/2003}] held that the Claims Tribunal could have
merely recorded that fact while allowing the application. In a situation
contemplated by Clause (b) of Section 170, nothing more was required
than recording that indisputable fact. For failure to do so, the
appellant shall not suffer prejudice. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>Therefore, the Appellant (insurance company) was justified in contesting

immediately, not after the pronouncement of judgment for consideration

<h2 id="c-no-fresh-or-additional-evidence">c) No fresh or additional evidence</h2>
<p>It should be borne in mind
that High Courts do not accept any fresh evidence or any additional
evidence later. In [(United India Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Rajendra
Singh &amp; Ors) 2000 ACJ p1032)] claimants claimed compensation for
injuries alleged to have been sustained by them in accident of Motor
Cycle they were riding and a Car. Claims Tribunal passed the award
against the insurance company. Subsequently insurance company came to
know that the claimants sustained injuries when their Tractor slipped
into a pit and they played a fraud against the insurance company. The
following questions were answered by the Apex Court. i.</p>
<p>Would the appeal by the insurance company against the award on the fresh
plea of fraud be maintainable? Apex Court in [2000 ACJ p 1032 (Para
14)] held that the consideration of appeal would be limited to issues
formulated from the pleadings.</p>
<p>i.. Should the High Court have considered the grievances of the insurance
company? Apex Court in [2000 ACJ p 1032 (Para 10 &amp;11)] held that the
writ jurisdiction is almost plenary for which no statutory constrictions
could possibly be imposed. A party to an order of court later
discovering that it was obtained by fraud should have some legal remedy.</p>
<p>i.. Must the claim be allowed to be resisted on grounds of fraud now
alleged by the insurance company? The Apex Court held that no Court or
Tribunal can be regarded as powerless to review its order if it is
convinced that the order was wrangled through fraud or misrepresentation
of such a dimension as would affect the very basis of the claim, as it
would lead to serious miscarriage of justice, so the claim is remitted
to Tribunal for afresh consideration.</p>
<h2 id="d-no-right-of-appeal-under-section-173">d) No right of appeal under Section 173</h2>
<p>Very often the question has
arisen as to whether an insurer is entitled to file an appeal under
Section 173 of 1988 Act on the grounds available to the insured, when
either there is a collusion between the claimants and the insured or
when the insured has not filed an appeal before the High Court
questioning the quantum of compensation. The consistent view had been
that the insurer has no right to file an appeal to challenge the quantum
of compensation or the finding of the Claims Tribunal as regards the
negligence or contributory negligence of offending vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="e-right-of-appeal-not-an-inherent-right">e) Right of appeal not an inherent right</h2>
<p>In [(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Nicolletta Rohtagi &amp; Ors.) (2002) 7 SCC 456)], the Supreme Court held
that the right of appeal is not an inherent right and as the Insurance
Company is permitted to contest only on the grounds stated in Section
149(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, the insurer cannot file an appeal
on any other ground, except in accordance with the procedure prescribed
under Section 170 of the 1988 Act. While recommending cases for appeal
the following aspects should be borne in mind: i.</p>
<p>Our liability is in question even though the award amount is less.</p>
<p>i . Such defence has been taken in our written statement. ii. . If
defence was taken, whether the same has been substantiated by any
documentary or oral evidence. iv. If files are referred on quantum only,
then insured&rsquo;s Vakalathnama should be sent along with the claim papers.
v. if insured remains ex-parte throughout the Lower Court proceedings,
then the Vakalathnama is not necessary for filing appeal on quantum. An
application u/s 170 can be filed. The legal position is now contained in
[(Nicolletta Rohtagi Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd.) AIR 2002 SC 3350:
2002 (7) SCC 456: 2002 (6) Supreme 362: 2002 ACJ 1950], that no insurer
can contest a claim on merits except after obtaining permission from the
Court by a reasoned order to do so. There is now a semblance of
certainty on the pre-condition to obtain relief under Section 170 for an
insurer.</p>
<h2 id="7-insurer-is-to-be-made-a-party">7. Insurer is to be made a Party</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, it is the liability of
the insured that is indemnified by the insurer. No insurer can be held
liable without the insured being liable in the first place [(Oriental
Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Sunitha Rani) - 1998 ACJ 121 (SC)]. The
relationship between the insured and insurer is contained in the
contract of insurance. Under Section 149 (1) of MV Act, 1988
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;, there is no need or compulsion for the insurer to be made
a party to the proceedings. The insured alone can be made a party and
contest it. The insured after such contest and an award can seek to
enforce his right to indemnity under the policy of insurance. On
production of vehicular records, the insurer if satisfied that no
defence under Section 149 (2) arose has to satisfy the award. Hence the
starting premise is that the insurer need not be a party to the claim
petition in original proceeding. a) When Insurer is to be Impleaded
Under Section 170, the insurer is entitled to avail impleading, if he
was not a party earlier, and upon such impleading (which is the vital
missing link remaining unaddressed for its importance) be entitled to
seek to contest the claim on all grounds, that would be available to the
insured. The crucial phrase is ‗upon such impleading‟. So it is only in
such of those cases where insurers were not already party and they got
themselves impleaded, that they are required to seek permission to
contest on merits under Section 170 of the MV Act 1988. This, however,
gives rise to another question whether Section 170 relief need not be
invoked in cases where the insurers were already parties? b) Whether
permission to contest is mandatory?</p>
<h2 id="authors-note-1">Authors note</h2>
<p>The legal position needs clarification by the Apex Court.
It needs to be made clear that permission under Section 170 of the Act
of 1988 was not mandatory in cases where the insurer was already a
party. Where insurer was made a party and the insured fails to contest,
by remaining ex-parte, the insurer must be automatically held entitled
to contest on merits, without any need for such application. Only in
cases where the insurer was not originally a party and they got
impleaded afterwards, there was a need for seeking permission by an
application under Section 170 of the Act of 1988 to contest on merits.</p>
<h2 id="c-whether-insurers-obligation-to-defend-is-contractual-and-legal">c) Whether Insurers obligation to defend is contractual and legal?</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, the insurer has a duty to contest on behalf of the
insured, under the policy of insurance. If the vehicular records are in
order and there is no conflict of interest, then the insurer has an
obligation to contest on behalf of the insured as they have agreed to do
so. Insurer also bear&rsquo;s the litigation costs involved. This being so,
insurers are entitled to contest along with the insured. When they so
contest before the Tribunal equally, they ought to be held entitled to
prefer an appeal as contesting parties. The appeal may be filed by the
insured, transposing the insurer as a respondent. Ultimately, it is the
insurer who foots the bill. The insurer has reserved the right to
contest on behalf of insured in the policy of insurance. More
importantly, the insurer has a solemn obligation to contest on behalf of
the insured. In fact, the insurer cannot be seen to be forsaking the
interests of his insured. The insured and the insurer can legitimately
contest before the Tribunal and they can well maintain an appeal on
merits. There is no earthly possibility of the insurer canvassing a
grievance under Section 149 (2) and still be joining forces with the
insured on merits. In (Mannarkatti case supra) an appeal filed by the
insured along with the insurer was not sustainable for the reason that
the insurer, not having filed an application under Section 170, cannot
be seen to be challenging an appeal on merits. In that case the insured
had remained ex-parte. The insurer alone had contested the proceedings.
A person suffering an ex-parte award, such as the insured, is entitled
to file the appeal against it. When joining forces with the insurer, it
is an expression of commitment by the insurer to contest on his behalf.
Ignoring all these aspects on the sole premise that no petition under
Section 170 was filed, it has been ruled that the appeal is not
sustainable.</p>
<h2 id="d-insurer-ignoring-to-contest">d) Insurer ignoring to contest</h2>
<p>Bhusan Sachdeva Case: This
imposition of the burden of Section 170 on the insurer, even in cases
where they were already made parties, has resulted in the insurer
refraining from contesting on behalf of the insured. Even in cases where
the insured come forward to co-operate with the insurer to contest, the
insurers quietly ignore the request and would rather await the insured
to fail to contest, because then the insurer can safely invoke the
remedy under Section 170.</p>
<p>DEFENSES AVAILABLE TO INSURERS</p>
<p>In [(United India Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Bhusan Sachdeva) 2002 (2) SCC
265 : 2002 ACJ 333 : AIR 2002 SC 662 : 2002 (1) Supreme 177] it has
taken note of the fundamental aspect of the insurer being an aggrieved,
as they were the paymasters and in the absence of contest by the
insured, they must be deemed to have taken over the defenses and the
Claims Tribunal having permitted a contest too. It is only that Bhusan
Sachdeva case supra can be better explained by reference to the aspects
as the requirement in Section 149 (1), a clause in the policy providing
for insurers to take over the defences of insured etc.</p>
<h2 id="e-failure-of-tribunal-to-pass-reasoned-order">e) Failure of Tribunal to Pass Reasoned Order</h2>
<p>As per pre-condition of Section 170, the
insurers tend to mechanically obtain the permission even at the time of
submitting written statement and contest the claims. They disregard the
interests of the insured or actual contest by the insured and would
rather much have them remain ex-parte. The requirement that relief under
Section 170 should be by way of reasoned order [(Shanakarayya Vs.
United India Insurance Co. Ltd.,) - 1998 ACJ 513] has been dispensed
with by the Apex Court [(United India Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs.
Jyotsnaben Sudhirbhai Patel) 2003 ACJ 2107: 2003 (7) SCC 212: 2003 (5)
Supreme 529] by holding that if the Tribunal fails to pass a reasoned
order; the insurer cannot be penalised on that count. Authors Note:
Section 170 has become a mere formality to be accomplished for the
record and nothing more. It is time the apex court adverted to it and
pronounced on it for a wholesome verdict to clear the confusion.</p>
<h2 id="f-insurers-remedy-in-statutory-appeal">f) Insurer‟s remedy in Statutory Appeal</h2>
<p>There may be instances of the
insured remaining ex-parte and the insurer not taking out an application
under Section 170. The need for a statutory appeal cannot be ignored
through the Article 227 route or revision petition under Section 115 CPC
to circumvent the need for Section 170. (Nicolletas Case supra) If so,
in the face of grossly disproportionate and unfair award, the insurer
has to acquiesce in it. The insurer must be deemed to have the right to
file an appeal along with the insured or even seek the relief under
Section 170 in appeal, as it is a continuation of the proceedings.
Otherwise it would be a case of the statute perpetrating an unjust set
of circumstances, which can never be said to be the basic purpose behind
the legislative intent.</p>
<h2 id="insureds-refusal-to-file-an-appeal-for-disproportionate-income">Insured‟s refusal to file an appeal for disproportionate income</h2>
<p>If the insured is contesting on its own, the insurer may be unable to
prove a case of collusion. In fact it could be a friendly contest and
upon an award of disproportionate extent, the insured may refuse to file
an appeal on behalf of the insurer. Can the insurer be expected to
acquiesce in and meekly pay up? The legislative intent cannot be read in
this manner. In such eventualities the insurer must be deemed to have
the right to seek the remedy of failure to contest or collusion even in
the appeal proceedings. Otherwise, the remedy under Section 170 would be
a harmful provision rather than an enabling provision for a meaningful
defence.</p>
<h2 id="ii-uncertainty-prevailing-us-170">ii. Uncertainty prevailing u/s 170</h2>
<p>The bottom-line is that
Section 170 is not necessary where the insured is already a party. Only
in cases where they were not already a party and get themselves
impleaded, upon such impleading permission under Section 170 will become
necessary. Further, the insurer has a solemn duty to contest on behalf
of the insured as a solemn contractual obligation. If so, they must be
seen to have the concomitant right to contest on behalf of the insured
in appeal. Ultimately, the requirement under Section 170 has to be seen
and appreciated for what it is. It is not a minor hurdle to be overcome
for the insurer, but is a provision with meaning and substance since the
insurer need not be a party in the first place under Section 149 (1).
The Supreme Court would be required to consider Section 170 from the
context of the phraseology upon such impleading and pronounce on it as
well, clarifying its purport and also on the sustainability of appeals
of insurer along with insured.</p>

<h2 id="h-defences-for-insurance-companies">H. Defences for Insurance Companies</h2>
<p>The defence for insurance companies
can be categorised under following heads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Breach of Policy Conditions</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The breach of policy conditions which have no nexus to the loss or
damage are interpreted leniently permitting contract to be set right at
the option of the insurance company for liabilities arising in future,
but the breach of material policy condition leave the Policy contract
void. Section 64 VB of Insurance Act, 1938 for advance payment of
premium makes contract void ab initio. Though the policy of insurance
was issued to commence from 4/5/96, the Court ruled that since the
premium was received in cash on 2/5/96, the insurer would be liable to
the Third Party victim for the accident dated 2/5/96 at 6 P.M.
[(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Sheela Bai) 2007 ACJ 798 (MP)]. This
judgment is contrary to the verdict of the Supreme Court in 1997 ACJ 351
(SC). Therefore, this section has been a matter of contest and differing
judgments by the Apex Court. The availability of insurance policy and
particulars has been held to be the burden on insurer [2008 (1) TLNJ
225 (Civil)]. It was held that when the claimants failed to furnish
particulars of insurance policy, it would suffice for the insurer to
deny the factum of insurance. The burden would be on the claimants to
furnish particulars to impose an obligation on the insurer to adduce
evidence that there was no insurance cover granted [(The Oriental
Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Karthikesan) 2007 (2) TN MAC 188 (Mad)]. If no
Insurance Policy, burden of Proof discussed [in {2008 (2) TLNJ 57
(Civil)} relying on {2004 ACJ 727} (contra view)].</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Who is a Third Party?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The very nomenclature third party would pre-suppose the existence
of two other parties. The insured or owner of the vehicle would be The
First Party and the insurer would be Second Party. All others would
appear to come within the ambit of the expression Third Party. Under
Section 147 MV Act, 1988 there is stipulation of mandatory cover to be
provided to third parties. But in the context of the statute it is not
every claimant who would come within the scope of a third party. The
driver, passengers in any class of vehicle, though commonly known as
third parties come outside the scope of Third Party under the 1988 Act.
They are required to be covered under Section 147 as driver, occupants
or passengers separately.</p>
<h2 id="important">Important</h2>
<p>Third Party is confined to those persons who are victims and
not travelling on the vehicle but are outside the vehicle.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Liability of insurer for driver of vehicle</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The driver of a vehicle is required to
be covered under Section 147 of Act 1988. But as per the provision it is
not any and every driver of a vehicle, who is required to be covered. It
is only such of those drivers who are engaged to drive, who are required
to be covered. In effect, employed drivers alone are required to be
covered. When the owner of the vehicle was driving the vehicle, he
obviously cannot file a claim for himself, though he is driver in the
literal sense of the meaning [(Dhanraj vs. New India Assurance Co.
Ltd. - 2005 ACJ 1 (SC)]. The insurer has offered cover for the
liability of the owner to third parties does not entitle him. Equally,
if a friend of the owner of the vehicle was driving a private car, then
he too would not be covered under the policy of insurance. Such friend
or any person, other than a driver engaged to drive would be entitled to
claim under Section 140 MV Act, 1988. As for entitlement to claim under
Section 163-A if such driver was himself at fault, he would not be
entitled to pursue the remedy. If the driver was a workman, then
notwithstanding the requirement to establish negligence before a Claims
Tribunal, the law has to accept a claim for such driver / workman under
EC Act, 1923 before MACT itself. It is not that drivers of all classes
of vehicles irrespective of their status as drivers are required to be
covered. It is only persons engaged as paid drivers who are required to
be covered. Such drivers, unless workmen, when not insured, would be
entitled to no more than ‗no fault liability&rsquo; amount payable under
Section 140 [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., vs. Krishnan) - 2004 ACJ
1790 (Mad)]. One further aspect that needs to be highlighted is that
the liability to such drivers would be restricted as per EC Act, 1923
under Liability Only Policy [National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Prembhai
Patel 2005 (3) Supreme 587].</p>
<h2 id="4-dishonour-of-cheque">4. Dishonour of Cheque</h2>
<h2 id="a-public-policy-to-prevail">a) Public Policy to prevail</h2>
<p>The question of dishonour of cheque came up for consideration in Oriental Insurance Co.
Ltd. vs. Inderjit Kaur and Ors [(1998) 1 SCC 371] wherein, it was
stated that a policy of insurance, which is issued in public interest
would prevail over the interest of the insurance company. Having regard
to the underlying public policy behind the statutory scheme in respect
of insurance as evidenced by Sections 147 and Section 149 of the Motor
Vehicle Act 1988, and in particular having regard to the fact that
policy of insurance was issued to cover the vehicle without receiving
the premium, the Court held that the insurance company was liable to
indemnify the insured. The said decision proceeded on the basis that the
insurance company was responsible for placing itself in the said
predicament as it had issued a policy of insurance upon receipt of a
Cheque towards the consideration, in contravention of the provisions of
Section 64-VB of the Insurance Act 1938. Applying the principle of
estoppel, the Court held that, the public interest in a situation of
that nature would prevail over the interest of the insurance company.</p>
<h2 id="b-insured-to-restore-the-advantage">b) Insured to restore the advantage</h2>
<p>Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act,
1872 states, that when a contract becomes void, the person who has
received any advantage under such contract is bound to restore it to the
person from whom he received it. Therefore, even though the insurer has
disbursed the amount covered by the policy to the insured before the
cheque was returned dishonoured, the insurer is entitled to
reimbursement of the money so received. However, if the insured pays the
premium even after the cheque was dishonoured, but before the date of
accident, it would be a different case as payment of consideration can
be treated as paid in the order in which the nature of transaction
required it. As such if event did not happen in this case, the Insurance
Company is legally justified in refusing to pay the amount claimed by
the respondents. A contract is based on reciprocal promise by the
parties which is a condition precedents for a valid contract. A contract
furthermore must be for consideration. In today&rsquo;s world, payment made by
cheque is ordinarily accepted as valid tender. Section 64VB of the 1938
Act also provides for such a scheme.</p>
<h2 id="c-section-64-vb">c) Section 64 VB</h2>
<p>In terms of Section 147 (5) and Section 149 (1) of the
Act, the Insurance Company became liable to satisfy awards of
compensation, notwithstanding its entitlement to avoid or cancel the
policy for the reason that the cheque issued for payment of premium had
not been honoured. The dicta laid down clarifies that if on the date of
the accident a policy subsists, then the third party would be entitled
to avail benefit. The decision was analysed in the light of Section
64-VB of the 1938 Act in [(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Seema
Malhotra and Ors.) (2001) 3 SCC 151]. The time of commencement of cover
is an important issue in fixing liability on insurers. An accident had
occurred at 8.15 a.m. It was found that the insurance coverage was
availed on the same day and only from 10.30 a.m. as mentioned in the
contract of insurance. Following the verdict [in (National Insurance
Co. Ltd. vs. N. Ponnaiyan) reported in 2005 ACJ 1103 (Mad)] it was held
that the insurer was not liable for the claim and the owner of the
vehicle has to answer the liability. [(New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs.
L. Sunderrajan 2007 (3) TLNJ 367 (Civil): 2007 (2) TN MAC 128].</p>
<h2 id="d-post-accident-cover">d) Post-accident cover</h2>
<p>The policy having been issued from 1/8/96 w.e.f.
09.00 a.m. the coverage would be only from that date and time and would
not cover an accident dated 31/7/96. Relevant decisions on this aspect
were considered. [in (NIC vs. Mangalakshmi) 2008 (4) LW 488]. e)
Policy was not produced Where the insurer has pleaded expiry of the
policy prior to accident and the same was not renewed, but did not
produce the insurance policy, the insurer was held liable for the claim
for absence of proof. [(UIIC vs. Kandan) 2008 (7) MLJ 123 (Mad)
(referring to 2007 (1) MLJ 234, 2003 (1) MLJ 268)]. In another case the
previous policy of insurance had expired on 29/6/94. The subsequent
policy was availed on and from 20/7/94 and the time of commencement of
cover was mentioned as 2 P.M. The accident had occurred on 9.15 A.M. It
was observed that in the face of the documented factum of the policy
commencing from 2 P.M. no liability could have been fastened on the
insurer. The appeal was allowed exonerating the insurer of any
liability. [(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Sobina Lakai) 2007 (2) TN

<h2 id="f-notice-of-dishonour-of-cheque">f) Notice of Dishonour of Cheque</h2>
<p>The premium cheque was dishonoured for
lack of adequate funds in the account of the insured; consequently the
insurance company cancelled the Policy contract. However, Insurance
Company failed to intimate Road Transport Authority. As the fact of no
balance in the account was within the knowledge of the insured,
therefore, no special notice was necessary and hence the liability of
the insurance company was extinguished. Following the verdicts of the
Apex Court in [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Inderjit Kaur) 1998 ACJ
123 (SC)] and [(New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Rula) in 2004 ACJ 630
(SC)], it was held that if it was found that notices of cancellation of
the covers were not intimated to the insured, the insurer cannot avoid
liability and their remedy may only be to seek recovery from the
insured. The cancellation of Policy earlier to the date of accident on
account of dishonour of premium cheque exonerates the insurance company
from Third Party Liability. The owner of the vehicle was driving it. The
insurer sent communications to the insured and the RTO about
cancellation of the policy of insurance. The accident had occurred after
such cancellation. The Supreme Court ruled that the insurer couldn&rsquo;t be
held liable for the claim in a case where the policy was cancelled by
the time the accident occurred. The inference is that the insurer can
avoid liability in such cases where the cancellation took place prior to
the occurrence of the accident.</p>
<h2 id="g-insured-cant-claim-performance">g) Insured can‟t claim performance</h2>
<p>In a contract of insurance when the insured gives a cheque towards payment of
premium or part of the premium, such a contract consists of reciprocal
promise. The drawer of the cheque promises the insurer that the cheque
on presentation would yield the amount in cash. It cannot be forgotten
that a cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker.</p>
<p>Definition A bill of exchange is an instrument in writing containing an
unconditional order, directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of
money to a certain person. It involves a promise that such money would
be paid. Therefore, if the insured fails to pay the premium promised, or
the bank concerned returns the cheque issued by him towards the premium
dishonoured, the insurer need not perform their part of the promise.
Under Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, an agreement made
without consideration is void. The corollary is that the insured cannot
claim performance from the insurer in such a situation.</p>
<h2 id="h-limited-obligation-of-insurer-under-ec-act-1923">h) Limited obligation of Insurer under E.C. Act, 1923</h2>
<p>In case of a
claim for compensation to a third party arising under the Employee&rsquo;s
Compensation Act, 1923, the obligation of the insurance company clearly
stands limited, and the relevant proviso providing for exclusion of
liability for interest or penalty has to be given effect to. The Supreme
Court in [(New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Harshadbhai Amrutbhai
Modhiya and Anr)-2006 (5) SCC 192], held that unlike the scheme of the
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988; the Employee&rsquo;s Compensation Act, 1923 does not
confer a right on the claimant for compensation to claim the payment of
compensation in its entirety from the insurer himself. The law relating
to contracts of insurance is part of the general law of contract. It was
approved by Lord Wilberforce in [(Reardon Smith vs. Hansen-Tangen) All
ER p. 576 h] said: It is desirable that the same legal principles
should apply to the law of contract as a whole and that different legal
principles should not apply to different branches of that law. A
contract of insurance is to be construed in the first place from the
terms used in it, which terms are to be understood in their primary,
natural, ordinary, and popular sense. A policy of insurance has to be
construed like any other legal contract. On construction of the
contract, it is clear that the insurer had not undertaken the liability
for interest and penalty, but had undertaken to indemnify the employer
only to reimburse among other things under the Employees Compensation
Act 1923. Unless one is in a position to avoid the exclusion clause
concerning liability for interest and penalty, imposed on the insured on
account of his failure to comply with the requirements of the Employees
Compensation Act of 1923, the insurer cannot be made liable to the
insured for those amounts.</p>
<h2 id="i-statutory-liability-vis-a-vis-a-third-party-of-insurer">i) Statutory liability vis-a-vis a Third Party of Insurer</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court in [(Deddappa &amp; Ors vs. National
Insurance Co. Ltd) [Appeal (Civil) 5829 of 2007}] arising out of SLP
(C) NO.7746 of 2006 held that they were not oblivious of the distinction
between the statutory liability of the Insurance Company vis-a-vis a
third party in the context of Sections 147 and 149 of the 1988 Act and
its liabilities in other cases. But the liabilities arising under the
contract of insurance would have to be met, if the contract is valid and
subsisting. If the contract of insurance has been cancelled and all
concerned have been intimated, we are of the opinion the insurance
company would not be liable to satisfy the claim.</p>
<h2 id="5-valid-driving-licence">5. Valid Driving Licence</h2>
<p>To avoid liability of the insured, the insurer
has to prove that the insured was guilty of negligence and failed to
exercise reasonable care in the matter of fulfilling the condition of
the policy regarding ‗use of vehicle&rsquo; by a duly licensed driver or one
who was not disqualified to drive at the relevant time. It was not open
to the insurer to dispute the validity of the driving licence in the
execution proceedings, when the issue had reached its finality in the
trial proceedings itself. [(United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Gulzar
Singh) 2007 ACJ 1265 (P&amp;H)] The driver was not holding a valid driving
licence to drive an auto rickshaw / transport vehicle. The owner was
also contesting the claim. In a rare decision of its kind, after
adverting to a catena of decisions, the High Court ruled that the
insurer could avoid liability in toto. The question of directing the
insurer to pay and seek recovery would not arise. The decision of the
Supreme Court in [(Kusum Rai in 2006 (4) SCC 250:2006 (1) TN MAC 9]
elaborated further by pointing out that in the said decision discretion
under Article 136 was exercised, as the claimants were poor and the
insured was not found to be contesting [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd.
vs. Sivammal) 2007 (2) TN MAC 216 (Mad)] . However, at the instance of
the insured, no right of recovery can be claimed against the insurer.
[2008 (1) TN MAC 15 (Jha)]</p>
<h2 id="authors-note-2">Author‟s Note</h2>
<p>The author feels that Insurance Company should not be
directed to perform charity, where they have no liability at all.
Legislature may commit such liability to be met through solatium fund to
meet out uninsured liabilities, instead of fastening the liability on
insurers, who are otherwise also required to serve the poor customers
and bear the consequences of such investment, where the probability of
recovery is remote? The following sections of the Motor Vehicle Act,
1988, govern the main provisions relating to driving licence. a) Section
2 (10) defines the term driving licence b) Section 3 (1) deals with the
necessity for driving licence. It states that no person shall drive a
motor vehicle in a public place unless he holds an effective driving
licence. c) Section 4 deals with the age limit d) Section 4 (2) where it
is stated that no person under the age of 20 years can drive a transport
vehicle.</p>
<p>e) Section 2 (19) defines the term Learning Licence. f) Section 7 deals
with the restriction on the granting of Learners Licence for certain
vehicles. It states that to hold a Learners Licence to drive Transport
Vehicles, one should have held driving licence for at least one year.
(The provision is being made more stringent by raising the limit to 2
years in the proposed Motor Vehicle (amendment) Bill 2007) g) Section 9
(3) (a i/ii/ii) the words DL to drive such class of vehicle, is used. h)
Section 10 deals with the form and contents of driving licence. It
elaborates classification of vehicles and the endorsements, which can be
passed by RTO i) Section 11 (i) authorizes the licensing authority to
add such other class or designation of motor vehicle to the driving
licence. j) Section 14 deals with the currency of licenses to drive the
motor vehicle i.</p>
<p>Learners Licence to be effective for 6 months from the date of issue.</p>
<p>i . Transport Vehicle licence is to be effective for 3 years from the
date of issue. Explanation: Transport vehicle carrying dangerous /
hazardous goods: the licence is effective for only one year. ii. . All
the other licenses are to be effective for 20 years from the date of
issue of licence or 50 years whichever is earlier. PROVIDED that every
driving licence shall, notwithstanding the expiry under the sub section
continue to be effective for a period of thirty days from such expiry.
k) Section 15 deals with the renewal of licences: Any expired licence
will have the grace period and will be effective from the date of expiry
till expiry of thirty days. If the renewal is obtained within 30 days of
its expiry, the licence will be renewed retrospectively from the date of
its expired date, if not the renewal will have only prospective effect,
i.e. from the date of its renewal. As per the 1988 Act and in
conjunction with the Central Motor Vehicle Rules and the State Motor
Vehicles Rules, the following type of licences are required to be given
to different class of vehicle. The effective driving licence means a
valid licence both as regard to period and type of vehicle [2002 ACJ p
319 (SC)]. On the other hand any fake driving licence if renewed
subsequently cannot become legally valid [2001 SCW p 1340 (SC)]. IC-72</p>
<p>The breach of policy condition e.g. disqualification of the driver or
invalid driving licence of the driver, as contained in Section
149(2)(a)(ii), has to be proved to have been committed by the insured,
for avoiding liability by the insurer by adopting following procedure:
(a) A specific plea should be taken in the written statement and the
Claims Tribunal should also frame an issue. (b) Extract of DL from the
concerned RTO should be produced in the Tribunal to prove the plea. (c)
Insurance company officials can also mark the extract of DL. Evidence
has to be let in by summoning the concerned RTO officials who have given
the extract of the DL through the Tribunal. The burden lies on the
insurer to plead and prove the case. Even then, unless there was breach
by the insured, the insurer cannot avoid liability. They may have to pay
and seek recovery from the insured. a) Cases where DL particulars are
not known Mere absence, fake or invalid driving licence or
disqualification of the driver for driving at the relevant time, are not
in themselves defences available to the insurer against either the
insured or third parties. The insurance company should plead and lead
with evidence and on failure, seek permission to avail all defences for
non-cooperation by the insured / driver under Section 170 by a separate
application moved in the Tribunal. i. An investigator should be
appointed to contact insured and driver at the given address to obtain
driving licence particulars. ii. The insurer must seek information by
Registered AD Post from the concerned RTO, where the driver normally
resides as per address given in the petitioners copy or revealed by the
investigator. iii. Reply of RTO for non-issue of licence is to be
carefully preserved. The outcome of both (i) &amp; (ii) is produced as
evidence in Claims Tribunal to show that the Insurance Company has taken
all steps to find out the validity of driving licence iv. The panel
Advocate should examine Insurance Company official on the aspect of
driving licence and that the particular person who was driving the
vehicle at the material time of accident. This may be carried out on the
basis of documents like FIR, Charge sheet, Form 54, and injury report of
the driver.</p>
<p>v. Any other eyewitness, who could be passengers of the vehicle if any
or the Doctor of the hospital who had given first aid etc. can also be
examined. The provision of Section 3 deals with the necessity for
driving licence &amp; Section 10 deals with the form and contents of driving
licence of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. Therefore, appreciation of
driving licence on the part of Apex Courts declarations, still appears
to be pay and recover in view of Supreme Court observations in [2004
ACJ 843] &amp; [2007 ACJ 1067] &amp; [2008 ACJ 776].</p>
<h2 id="b-fake-licence">b) Fake Licence</h2>
<p>In the case of fake driving licence, the question of indemnity from insurer
would be available only in case of a Third Party claim. Only for Third
Party victims (not where owner or passengers were involved), insurer can
be asked to pay and recover [(NIC Vs. Kaushalaya Devi) 2008 (4) Supreme
441]. The own damage claim being contractual liability would not be on
the same footing and insurer would be entitled to refuse indemnity
[(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Laxmi Narain Dutt) 2007 (II) ACC 28
(SC)] . If the DL is fake, the insurer would not be liable, but has to
pay and recover. But such pay and recover award would be applicable only
in Third Party claims, meaning victims of the road and not persons such
as passengers. [(NIC vs. Geetha Bhat) in CA No. 2257/2008 dt.31/3/2008
can avail the benfit. The insurer can avoid liability to pay only, if
they prove that the owner was aware of the fake nature of DL and still
entrusted the vehicle to such driver. The inference is that the right of
recovery is only in case of Third Party victims, not where the victims
are passengers; also insurer is exonerated from OD liability. Where the
DL is fake, the insurer is not liable and any amount paid by way of
interim orders can be recovered from the insured. For Balance amount the
claimants have to proceed against owner / driver only [2008 (1) TN MAC
115 (SC) (Prem Kumari vs. Prahlad Dev)]. Once the DL is fake, its
renewal cannot confer validity. [OIC vs. Prithiviraj 2008 (2) MLJ 913
(SC)]. It is the ratio in [Davinder Singh) 2008 (2) LW 10 (SC)]:
[(UIIC vs. Davinder Singh) 2008 ACJ 1]. Any counterfeit document
showing that it contains a purported order of a statutory authority
would ever remain counterfeit, albeit the fact those other persons
including some statutory authorities would have acted on the document
unwittingly on the assumption that it was genuine. Once a licence is
found fake, its renewal cannot take away the effect of a fake licence.
It was observed in Kamla case [SC p. 347, Para 12] and Section 15 of
the 1988 Act only empowers any licensing authority to renew a driving
licence issued under the provisions of this Act, with effect from the
date of its expiry. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>No licensing authority has the power to renew a fake licence, therefore,
a renewal if at all made, cannot transform a fake licence into a genuine
one. The whole protection provided by Chapter XI of the 1988 Act is
against third party risk [Oriental Insurance Company Limited vs. Meena
Variyal and Ors. [2007 (5) SCALE 269]. Therefore, in a case where a
person is not a third party within the meaning of the Act, the insurance
company cannot be made automatically liable merely by resorting to the
ratio in [(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Swaran Singh and Other)
(2004) 3 SCC 297].</p>
<h2 id="c-effective-driving-licence">c) Effective Driving Licence</h2>
<p>The defences open to
the insurer are circumscribed by Section 149 (2). One of the major
defences that come within its ambit is the absence of an effective
driving licence to the driver of the insured vehicle. The burden is
squarely on the insurer to plead and prove that the driver did not held
an effective driving license [(Narcinva V. Kamat vs Alfredo Antonio Doe
Martins) - 1985 ACJ 397 (SC)]. To begin with, in such claims the driver
was also a party. But it is now well settled that the driver is not a
necessary party to the proceedings. The insurer was expected to send
notices to the insured and the driver to produce the driving licence,
summon the records from RTA, if particulars were available, and also
produce the Criminal court records on whether the driver and / or owner
were also prosecuted, examine their officials and mark the insurance
policy to draw the attention of the Court to the relevant clause in the
policy of insurance. Such burden cast on the insurer was very heavy and
any lapse, thereof, worked to the benefit of the claimants. Then came a
line of decisions suggesting that the insurer was even obliged to summon
the driver and examine him to prove their case [(Rukmani vs The New
India Assurance Co. Ltd.) 1998 (9) SCC 160]. In a case where the
driving licence had expired, the insurer was held to be not liable
[(New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Sudesh Kumari)]. The burden is
squarely on the insurer to plead and prove absence of driving licence.
If the insurer took necessary steps to discharge the burden and the
insured kept silent, then adverse inference shall be drawn against the
owner of the vehicle. The insurer would then be entitled to seek right
of recovery from the insured. [(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Krishnammal) 2007 (5) MLJ 1038 (Mad)]. If the Driving Licence was not
valid to drive a commercial vehicle, the suit for own damage claim is to
be dismissed in [(M. Chidambaram vs. UIIC Ltd) 2008 (5) MLJ 193]. 404</p>
<p>A Motorcycle rider was not possessing valid Driving Licence being a
statutory risk cover the insurer was held liable to pay and seek
recovery [2008 (6) MLJ 99]. However, it was held that without
particulars of Driving Licence, the insurer cannot search all the RTOs
to adduce evidence. [2008 1 TN MAC 191 (Ma)]</p>
<h2 id="d-disqualified-from-holding-or-obtaining-a-licence-only-where-driver-held-a-licence">d) Disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence only where driver held a licence</h2>
<p>The insurers were thus compelled to satisfy these requirements without any
relief. The Courts found that on such satisfaction of the burden by the
insurers, under the dispensation under MV Act, 1939, the insurers could
avoid liability. The lot of the claimants was placed in a tricky
position. Therefore, on closer examination of the relevant clause in the
policy of insurance, it was found that there was a phrase reading and is
not disqualified from holding or obtaining driving licence. In a case
where the driver was prosecuted under Section 3 and owner under Section
5 and both had been convicted on admission of guilt, the insurer could
be set to have discharged the burden cast on them by adducing such proof
and marking the policy of insurance to avoid liability. Hence, the High
Court of Madras ruled in [(The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs C. B.
Shankar) 1986 ACJ 82 (Mad)] that mere proof of absence of driving
licence would not suffice for the insurer. They had undertaken the
burden of not proving absence of driving licence but also the
disqualification of the driver to hold or obtain driving licence. There
was no evidence adduced by insurer to demonstrate that the driver was so
disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence and therefore insurer
cannot avoid liability. Even in a case where the driver never held a
licence, this disqualification was held against the insurer. It was
obviously erroneous. Disqualification ought to be construed as
pre-supposing the existence of a valid licence prior to point of time in
question. This was clarified in [(National Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs.
Thulasi) -1994 (1) LW 567]. In a case where the driver obtained the
licence after the accident and it was argued that the fact the driver
had obtained the licence subsequent to accident must be held as proof
that the driver was not disqualified. The insurer was held not liable as
the driver held no licence at all prior to the date of the accident.
Hence it can now be taken that disqualification aspect would come into
play only where the driver held a licence before the accident.</p>
<h2 id="e-deliberate-willful-and-intentional-act-of-insured-owner">e) Deliberate, willful and intentional act of Insured owner</h2>
<p>i. A person
drove a vehicle without a driving licence, but was found to be not the
regular driver of the insured. i.</p>
<p>. The insured had entrusted the vehicle to his regular driver and the
driver in course of journey chose to entrust the vehicle to another
person, say cleaner as in [(Skandia Insurances case) 1987 ACJ 411
(SC)] and the cleaner held no licence, the insurers prayer for
exoneration was rejected by the Supreme Court explaining the expression
breach as used in the statute as well as the policy of insurance.</p>
<p>i.. It was held that breach cannot be so easily attached on the insured.
Obviously, the insured had done his bit when he entrusted the vehicle to
a regular, licensed driver. If in the course of the journey, such driver
chose to entrust the vehicle, without the knowledge and authority of
insured, to a cleaner who was unlicensed, such breach cannot be attached
on the insured. [(New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Mohinder Singh) 2007
ACJ 936 (P&amp;H)]: [2007 (II) ACC 866]: [(National Insurance Co. Ltd.
vs. Salinder Kumar) 2007 ACJ 1181 (P&amp;H)]: [(New India Assurance Co.
Ltd. vs. Ratibai) 2007 ACJ 1119 (MP)]: [(United India Insurance Co.
Ltd. vs. Shakuntala Sharma) 2007 ACJ 1134 (Raj)]:</p>
<p>iv. A minor aged 15 years is driving the Motor Vehicle. The insurer is
not liable. [2008 (1) CTC 50]. The breach to enable the insurer to
avoid liability, must therefore, be deliberate, willful and intentional,
meaning thereby, the insured was aware that his driver was unlicensed
and still chose to entrust the vehicle to him. Hence the burden of proof
placed on the insurer was put on a higher pedestal, making it thereby,
virtually impossible for the insurers to avoid liability. In a series of
judgments it was made clear by various High Courts that such
construction of the statute was only in keeping with the mandate of
Parliament to ensure that the victims were provided compensation by the
insurer, rather than be left to the fate of seeking enforcement from
owner of vehicle. The slant of the courts was evident and it was made
clear as well that compulsory motor insurance was to provide relief to
victims and if so, the courts have to necessarily lean in favour of this
mandate.</p>
<p>406</p>
<h2 id="f-absence-of-driving-licence">f) Absence of Driving Licence</h2>
<p>i. Where the driver admitted the absence
of driving licence, the insurer was held liable to pay, but declared
entitled for recovery from the insured. [(Hans Raj vs. Anil Sachdeva)
2007 (4) TAC 179 (P&amp;H)]: [(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Sarala
Pasayat) 2007 (4) TAC 591 (Ori)]. i.</p>
<p>. However, in another case, the insurer was denied the defence that the
driver did not possess a valid driving licence to drive the bus, since
it was found that there was no pleading made by him even to prosecute
the defence. [(Akhilesh Gupta vs. Arvind Kumar) 2007 ACJ 2477 (MP)].</p>
<p>i.</p>
<p>. In a most recent case absence of driving licence for tractor was held
sufficient to exonerate insurer from liability. [(Sardari vs. Sushil
Kumar) 2008 (2) Supreme 451]: [2008 (1) TN MAC 294].</p>
<h2 id="g-expired-driving-licence">g) Expired Driving Licence</h2>
<p>In the specific case of persons holding
expired licences, it was found that the under the then India Motor
Tariff regime, the insurers had used the expression ‗has held‟ in the
licence clause. This was interpreted to mean that in the experience of
the insurers, holding a permanent licence, even if expired would
suffice. Such drivers must be deemed to be competent as well. Mere
expiry of licence, therefore, would not enable insurers to avoid
liability [(Srinivasa Roadways Vs. Saroja) 1975 ACJ 265: AIR 1975 (Mad)
126: 88 LW 144 : 1974 (2) MLJ 364]. With MV Act, 1988 coming into force
the India Motor Tariff provisions were also amended. The expression has
held was removed from the policy purview. As per Form 51 of Central
Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 the expression now used is „holds‟ in the
present continuous and not past participle. If so, the insurer claimed
that under the new dispensation they can no longer be held liable if the
licence had expired. This argument was held hollow in the face of the
use of conjunction and in the licence clause including and is not
disqualified from holding or obtaining. The driving licence was not
renewed in time, within the stipulated 30 days. It was held that insurer
cannot avoid liability, more so, when the occurrence of accident was
unrelated to the cause vide [2004 ACJ 1 (SC). [(National Insurance Co.
Ltd. vs. Sushil Kumar) 2007 ACJ 2230 (P&amp;H)]. Also read [(New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Phelisha Bakai) 2007 ACJ 2388 (Gau)] for a
contra view. If the accident occurs within 30 days of the expiry of
Driving Licence; the Driving Licence could have been renewed and,
therefore, is deemed to be valid and effective [(Ram Babu Tiwari vs.
UIIC Ltd) 2008 (3) TLNJ 312].</p>
<p>Where the driving licence had expired and renewal was not availed within
30 days provided, then the insurer would not be liable. [(New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Sudesh Kumari) 2007 (II) ACC 386 (HP)]. Where
the owner himself was the driver and the driving licence had expired and
not renewed in time, it was held that exoneration of insurance company
was proper. [(Dhirendra Singh Sengar vs. Gopi Singh Kalicharan) 2007
(3) TAC 755 (MP]). Therefore, except in cases where the drivers never
held a licence, it was evident that insurers cannot escape liability.
For one reason or another factual matrix was held against the insurer.
In a case where the licence had expired prior to accident and was
renewed afterwards, it was held that the fact that the driver had got
his licence renewed was proof that he was not disqualified from holding
or obtaining one. Hence, the insurer was held obliged to not only prove
absence of effective licence but also that the driver was disqualified
in [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Indrani) 1995 ACJ 703: 1995 (1)
MLJ 82] which position of law has since been affirmed by the apex court
also in 2004 ACJ 1 (Swaran Singhs Case). On expiry of Driving Licence
the Insurer is not liable. [(Ram Babu Tewari vs. UIIC Ltd) 2008 (6) MLJ
1056 (SC)]. [(NIC vs. Vidhyadhar Mahariwala) 2008 (7) Supreme 89]
also is to the same effect.</p>
<h2 id="h-learners-licence">h) Learner‟s Licence</h2>
<p>Holding a Learner‟s Licence LLR itself is no ground to refuse indemnity for the insurer.
[(Daulat Ram vs. Kuri) 2007 ACJ 1449 (Raj)]: The insurer cannot avoid
liability on the ground that the driver held only LLR driving licence.
[(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Chakali Rangaiah) 2007 (4) TAC 650
(AP)]. The owner / rider of the 2-wheeler held a LLR and the pillion
rider did not hold a driving licence. It was held that the insurer was
not liable in such circumstances, since the LLR holder shall have to be
accompanied by an instructor holding a valid driving licence. Therefore,
the insurer was granted the right of recovery. The distinction may be
relevant in certain cases where such LLR holder may not carry a pillion
rider. In such cases, there would be no contravention of Rule 3 of CMV
Rules, 1989, since in the case of 2-wheelers the second proviso to the
said Rule contemplates an exception. A LLR holder of a 2wheeler can ride
himself and if a pillion rider accompanies him then such pillion rider
shall have to hold a permanent driving licence. It is only in the case
of 4-wheelers that the LLR holder cannot drive without an instructor in
tow.</p>
<p>However even under the earlier dispensation LLR holder was competent to
claim indemnity from insurer, except in cases where the LLR itself was
not current and valid on the date of accident. It was also made clear by
insurers by circulars that in view of the use of the parentheses in the
licence clause (other than a learners licence) in contra-distinction to
permanent licence, the insurer would be liable, even where the driver
held a LLR. They would escape liability in cases where the LLR had
expired prior to accident and no permanent licence was also obtained.
This distinction has been missed out by almost every judgment relating
to LLR, including in Tambes case [(New India Assurance Co. Ltd., Vs.
Mandhar Madhav Tambe) AIR 1996 SC 1150: 1996 (2) SCC 328: 1996 (1) ACC
392: 1996 ACJ 253] the Supreme Court ruled that the insurer can escape
liability in a case where the driver possessed only a LLR. In the
specific case of learners licence the Supreme Court, did not note the
specific clause in the policy properly. In that case the LLR had
actually expired prior to date of accident.</p>
<h2 id="i-effective-driving-licence">i) Effective Driving Licence</h2>
<p>Under the 1939 Act on proof of breach by the insured, the insurer could
a avoid liability. Section 96 (3) and 96 (4) though provided for a
recovery right to insurer and also under the policies of insurers vide
Important Conditions, the insurer could avoid liability on proof of a
defence under Section 96 (2). But under the present dispensation ushered
in as of 1/7/89, Sections 149 (3) and 149 (4) though seemingly of the
same language have led to completely and dramatically different
construction. A simple carry forward from the earlier era without
realising the different classification of the provisions has led to this
remarkable benefit to the community of victims. Parliament, of course,
is deemed to have applied its mind in passing any legislation. In view
of the changed situation under Sections 149 (3) and (4) it is the stated
legal position that notwithstanding proof of absence of effective
licence for the driver; the insurer would have to pay. As for recovery,
the insurer has to establish that the insured was in deliberate breach
and the accident was caused by such absence of driving licence etc. The
authoritative pronouncement in this regard is in Swaran Singhs case
supra. A careful reading of the said decision would disclose that the
Learned Judges were convinced that it was their solemn duty to ensure
that the insurers shall be made to pay as otherwise the direction to pay
would be meaningless to the victims. They were well supported by earlier
decisions and therefore they concluded that for the insurer avoiding
liability was next to impossible. And even for recovery, the degree of
proof for the insurer was pegged very high.</p>
<p>Thus the lot of accident victims have been well protected to ensure that
irrespective of the nature of proof/evidence of the insurer on absence
of driving licence, the claimants would still be entitled for the relief
and the insurer after all the labouring would only be entitled to the
elusive remedy of right of recovery from the insured. So be it.</p>
<h2 id="j-licence-for-transport-vehicles">j) Licence for Transport Vehicles</h2>
<p>Let us consider Section 10 of MV Act,
1988 as amended on 14/11/94. The said provision relates to Form and
Contents of driving licences. The sub clauses (e) to (h) from 10 (2)
were deleted as of 14/11/94 removing the classifications as Heavy Goods
Vehicle, Heavy Passenger Vehicle, Medium Goods Vehicle and Medium
Passenger Vehicle and introducing one omnibus clause in Transport
Vehicle. This necessarily meant that a person having an endorsement to
drive a Transport Vehicle would be entitled to drive all classes of
transport vehicles. All the different classes of transport vehicles
having come under one fold, they ought to be read so. In fact the RTAs
themselves would not be entitled to mention any more than Transport
Vehicle and this meant that a person&rsquo;s entitled to drive on such
endorsement, can drive all classes of transport vehicles. This
interpretation was also so accepted by the State Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission, Chennai in [(New India Assurance Co. Ltd., Vs.
Ambika) 2003 (3) CPJ 155]. i.</p>
<h2 id="competency-for-class-or-type-of-vehicle">Competency for class or type of Vehicle</h2>
<p>However, one conundrum needs detailed explaining. Under Section 9 (5) a
person&rsquo;s competence has to be tested in a particular class or type of
vehicle. The driver held driving licence of LMV but did not have an
endorsement to drive HGV. The insurer was not liable. It has been made
clear that pay and recover was permissible only for third party
claimants, namely those on the road and outside the vehicle. [(NIC vs.
Kaushalya Devi) CA No.9910/2006 dt.13/5/2008]. In Annappas case the
Supreme Court has held that LMV holder can drive HGV also. [2008 (1) TN
MAC 200 (SC).] : [2008 (3) SCC 464]. If so, he can be held competent
only in that category. While so, the licence granted to him shall read
one common transport vehicle. There is no type of vehicle as transport.
Within transport vehicle it could be HGV, HPV or whatever. If so, a
person testing for competence in a specific vehicle as HGV or HPV was
now deemed authorised and competent to drive any other class of
transport vehicle or all of them as the case may be.</p>
<p>In a case, where Driving Licence was valid and effective to drive
3-wheeler, but the vehicle involved in accident was a Goods Vehicle, the
insurer was held not liable. [(NIA vs. Roshanben Rahemansha Fakir) in
CA No. 3496/2008 dt.12/5/2008]: [2008 (4) Supreme 396].</p>
<h2 id="ii-lack-of-authorisation-to-drive-appropriate-vehicle">ii. Lack of authorisation to drive appropriate vehicle</h2>
<p>In the absence of endorsement
to drive a 2-wheeler, the insurer is not liable. [(OIC vs. Amma ponnu)
2008 (3) TLNJ 215 (Civil)]. In (CA No. 3055/2008 dt.29/4/2008) in
[(OIC vs. Zaharulnisha) [2008 (1) TN MAC 123 (Mad)]. In the absence
of Badge to drive auto rickshaw, it was held that examination of RTO
official was not necessary. The insurer was held not liable but was
directed to pay and seek recovery. The driver held a LMV driving licence
and only subsequent to accident, obtained an endorsement to drive a HGV
and it was held that the insured&rsquo;s father cannot be said to be unaware
of the absence of requisite valid driving licence for his son and the
insurer would not be liable for the claim. But in the circumstances of
this case insurer was directed to pay and seek recovery from the
insured. [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Syed Ibrahim) 2007 (6)
Supreme 574]: [2007 (4) LW 782:2007 (4) TAC 385]. The driver
possessed a driving licence for LMV, while he was found driving
Commercial Jeep carrying passengers. The lack of authorisation to drive
a Taxi was held a breach, but it was held that the insurer would have to
pay and seek recovery. [(Radhabai vs. H K Siddiqui) 2007 ACJ 991
(MP)]: [(Darshan Singh vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd) 2007 ACJ 2001
(P&amp;H)]: [(United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Dhulipalla Prameela
Devi) 2007 ACJ 2321 (AP)]: [(Malkiat Singh vs. Mohinder Singh) 2007
ACJ 2370 (P&amp;H)]. In another case the driver possessed LMV driving
licence with authority to drive Maxi Cab. The argument that he was not
authorized to drive a Tourist Taxi was negatived. [(National Insurance
Co. Ltd. vs. Kanakammal) 2007 (4) LW 994 (Mad): 2008 (1) TLNJ 93
(Civil)]. However, in a case holding a LMV driving licence was not
found sufficient, if the vehicle involved was a Commercial / Transport
vehicle. The insurer in this case was exonerated from liability. [(The
Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Sivammal) 2007 (3) TLNJ 487 (Civil)]:
[2007 (6) MLJ 384] &amp; [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Bhimala Pavan
Kumar) 2007 (3) T A C 989 (AP)]. The Supreme Court has now
categorically ruled that mere possession of LMV driving licence would
not suffice, if the vehicle in question was registered as a Transport
Vehicle. In the absence of any endorsement in the driving licence to
drive the said class of vehicle, the insurer would not be liable to meet
the Own Damage claims. [(New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Prabhu Lal)
2007 (8) Supreme 343]: [2008 (1) TN MAC 97].</p>
<p>As the driver had held a driving licence to drive a Public Service
Vehicle and a Heavy Transport Vehicle, he was held entitled to drive a
Heavy Goods vehicle as well as Heavy Passenger Vehicle. The insurer was
denied the right to avoid liability and as such the right of recovery
granted to the insurer was set aside.[(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Om Prakash) 2007 ACJ 2634 (J&amp;K)]. Where the vehicle was LMV and the
driver possessed a driving licence to drive a Heavy Vehicle, the insurer
could not to dispute liability. [Sanjay vs. Akhilesh 2007 ACJ 771 (MP):
[(United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Joseph Rochunga) 2007 (II) ACC
562 (Gau)]: [(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Nalini U. Mallya) 2007
(3) ACC 185 (Kant)]. The driver possessed authorisation to drive a
Heavy Goods Vehicle but did not possess endorsement to drive such a
vehicle carrying dangerous and hazardous goods as required by CMV Rules,
1989. It was held that its absence was not material since it did not
affect the competence of the drive and did not prove that the accident
was traceable to its absence. [(Baghelkhan Filling Station vs. Brijbhan
Prasad) 2007 (II) ACC 457 (MP)]. The driver held a driving licence to
drive HGV, but did not hold the driving licence to ride 2- wheeler. The
insurer was held not liable but asked to pay and recover. It was made
clear that such recovery was only for third party victims and not for
those inside the vehicle as passengers.</p>
<p>Author Note The legislators need to explain the implications of type of
Transport vehicles for clarity of provisions. Section 10(2)of MV Act has
been amended as of 14/11/94, and the corresponding Form in the CMV
Rules, 1989 was amended from 2001. Significantly though even now Medium
Passenger Vehicle finds a mention in the Form under the Rules.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Motor Vehicle requisitioned by the Statutory Authority</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The motor vehicle
insured with an insurer was requisitioned during assembly election by
SDM through appropriate authority and was under the possession and
control of the said officer. The death of a third party was caused by
the officer, which led to a claim under Section 166 of 1988 Act
impleading the SDM and the State. In the above case, save and except for
the legal ownership, for all intent and purposes, the registered owner
of the vehicle lost control over the vehicle due to requisition made by
the SDM in exercise of power conferred upon him under the Peoples
Representation Act.</p>
<p>Since the owner of the vehicle cannot refuse to abide by the order of
requisition of the vehicle, he does not exercise any control while the
vehicle remains under requisition. The driver may still be the employee
of the owner of the vehicle, but he has to drive it as per the direction
of the officer of the State who is put in charge of it. The Apex Court
in [(National Insurance company vs. Deepa Devi) (2008) 1 SCC 414)];
having regard to definition of owner as contained in Section 2(30) of
the 1988 Act, and to the fact that the vehicle in question was not used
for the purpose for which the contract of insurance was entered into,
held that the State shall be liable to pay compensation and not the
registered owner of the vehicle and consequently not the insurer.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Passengers carried in Goods Vehicle</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Section 147 of the 1988 Act purports
to insure person or classes of persons under Act only policy as follows:
i. In case of the goods vehicles, Policy covers the driver and employees
carried in the vehicle (up to EC Act liability only) employed in
connection with the operation and maintenance of the vehicle, owner of
goods or his authorised representatives, and persons outside the
vehicle. i . In case of the public service vehicles, Policy covers the
passengers and persons outside the vehicle under Act only Policy. It
also covers Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation liability of employed driver,
conductor and ticket examiner. In case of private vehicle (2 or
4-wheeler) Policy covers the driver (up to Employees Compensation Act
liability only), and persons outside the vehicle. The restricted
insurance coverage applies only when insured opts for the Act only /
Liability policy. If the insured is prepared to pay extra premium, the
liability is covered as per the Indian Motor Tariff guidelines for
Comprehensive / Package policy of two wheeler and Private Car, as
inbuilt coverage for occupants of the vehicle (not carried for hire or
reward) up to the limit of seating capacity of the vehicle. The non-fare
paying or fare paying passengers / gratuitous passengers can be covered
by paying extra premium up to the limit of liability chosen by the
insured under Personal Accident cover. However, in case of excess
carrying of passengers, or passengers carried in goods vehicle, MACT has
been doling out adverse verdicts against the insurance companies,
keeping in view the Policy contract terms and conditions vis--vis
provisions of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, permitting passengers in various
type of vehicles, specified numbers of passengers permitted to travel in
certain type of vehicles and specified persons authorised to drive such
vehicles.</p>
<p>It is a fact that it is a common practice on our highways Heavy Vehicle
drivers, solicit carriage of persons stranded or looking for transport
for a price or even offer to carry them gratuitously. The number of
accidents involving such vehicles is also very large. Also, accidents
leave behind a trail of destruction in host of victims, making it
difficult for the insurers to defend their interest.</p>
<h2 id="a-who-is-a-gratuitous-passenger">a) Who is a Gratuitous Passenger?</h2>
<p>Gratuitous Passenger is the person carried in a
vehicle for the ride without paying fare i.e., a Nishulk Yatri. Such
occupants of the vehicle may or may not be known to the owner-insured of
the vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example</h2>
<p>For example, the pillion rider of two wheeler, occupants of the
private car, occupants of goods carriage other than those employed as
driver and workmen in connection with the operation and maintenance of
the vehicle, person other than the passengers, employed as driver,
conductor, ticket examiner carried in public service vehicles. Under
Section 147 of MV Act 1988, no statutory liability has been enjoined on
the owners to get vehicles insured for such class of persons under the
Act only policy issued in compliance to the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988,
despite existence of Section 147-(1) (b) (i) including any person. The
words „any person‟ as used in Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act,
1988, would not include passengers or occupants of the vehicle, but
would rather be confined to the legislative intent to provide for third
party risk outside the insured vehicle. In [(Ramshrey vs. New India
Assurance Co. Ltd) date of judgement 22.07.03] where a cleaner of the
bus died in the accident, the Supreme Court held that as no premium for
cleaner was paid, and premium payment was for only 1 driver and 13
passengers, under Section-147 of the MV Act 1988, the cleaner of the bus
is not statutorily covered. b) Obligation of insurers In [(National
Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Baljit Kaur and Others) date of judgement
06/01/2004] it was held that the word ‗any person‟ in Section 147(1)
(b) (i) was not intended by the legislature to include passengers, who
are gratuitous or otherwise present in the goods carriage, but is
intended to address third parties, that is why separate amendment of
1994 was made to include owner of the goods or its authorised
representatives.</p>
<h2 id="c-any-person-is-not-every-person">c) „Any person‟ is not every person</h2>
<p>If the word ‗any person&rsquo; had
included ‗every person&rsquo; in the vehicle, than there was no need to
include owner of the goods or his representative separately in goods
carriage by an amendment. The corollary is that the owner of the vehicle
is not enjoined with any responsibility under Section 147 of the 1988
Act to take coverage for the gratuitous passengers, and the insurer is
not under any obligation to indemnify the insured for the death or
injury to any gratuitous passenger. It has been repeatedly held that
under 1939 Act, the insurer was not liable for gratuitous occupants,
fare paying passengers and owner or representative of owner of goods
carried in a goods vehicle. [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Thukarama
Adappa) 2007 ACJ 1497 (Kant)]. It has been made clear that only those
persons who are workmen are required to be covered and no one else is
visualised under statutory coverage. i.</p>
<h2 id="position-until-141194">Position until 14/11/94</h2>
<p>The legal position as enunciated therein is good law under MV Act, 1988
too, except to the limited extent of extending it to owners or
representatives of owners of goods also as of 14/11/94 as confirmed in a
recent judgement that the expression any person in a Goods Vehicle would
refer only to owner of goods or authorised representative. As per
Section 147 of Motor Vehicle Act 1988, representative or owner of the
goods carrying vehicle cannot travel in the Goods carriage in terms of
the definition of Goods carriage given in 1988 Act. However, as per
14-11-1994 amendments to Motor Vehicle Act 1988, the representative or
owner of the goods is allowed to travel in goods carriage, and the
insurance company is liable to pay compensation.</p>
<h2 id="ii-any-person-and-vehicle-a-generic-expression">ii. „Any person and vehicle‟ a generic expression</h2>
<p>Even while adverting to the fact that as
of 14/11/94 owners or representative of owners of goods, were
contemplated for statutory coverage, a curious but significant fact on
record had hitherto gone unnoticed. Under MV Act, 1939, persons carried
in a goods vehicle were not required to be covered. Calls went out that
considering the notorious fact of such carriage of persons Parliament
introduced Act 54 of 1994 with an amending clause to Section 147 (1).
Now, sub-section (1) of Section 147 is in relation to ‗any person and
vehicle&rsquo; a generic expression and it does not relate to Goods Vehicle
alone but to every class of vehicle. If so, it appears that a clever
argument can be mounted that in any class of vehicle if a person was
travelling as owner of the vehicle or as representative of owner of the
vehicle then statutory coverage was offered.</p>
<p>This may help the cause of victims who are travelling as pillion riders
or gratuitous occupants in a private car, who are now held not covered
under an Act Policy vide the recent decision of Supreme Court in
[(Tilak Singhs case) 2006 (2) CTC 661]. A clever argument can be built
since the phraseology of owner or representative of owner of goods is
not incorporated in a sub-section, which is confined in its application
to Goods Vehicle; it would be held applicable to all classes of
vehicles. The statute is silent as to how it is confined to Goods
Vehicle. The applicability of doctrine of pay and recover in this arena
ought to be restricted to those judgments which were rendered until
3/12/2002 (Asha Rani Case supra) and in respect of judgments after
3/12/2002 the insurer ought to be exonerated completely. In the absence
of proof that the occupant had paid hire for his carriage in the goods
vehicle, he would be a gratuitous occupant and a third party within the
meaning of Sec.145 (g) and entitled to compensation. [(New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Girvarnath) 2007 (II) ACC 493 (MP)]</p>
<h2 id="d-binding-case-law-on-the-subject-">d) Binding Case Law on the subject ******</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, pay and recover, as
a theme of action has to be in cases where the insurer is otherwise
liable. In a case where the insurer has not covered the risk of the kind
sought for, there is no scope for liability to be fastened on them. If
so, to direct the payment against insurer and seek recovery from the
insured would be improper. An insurance company is on strong grounds in
taking the stand against passengers in a goods carriage as it amounts to
breach of condition of Goods Carriage. Passengers carried in Goods
carriage, be it for hire or reward or gratuitous passengers, contravenes
definition of Goods carriage as per Section 2 (14) of 1988 Act and
amounts to use for a purpose other than for which permit was issued. In
a case where the victim was carried in a goods vehicle on 1/6/91, the
date of accident, it was held that statutorily there was no cover for
the insurer. The insurer was held not liable to meet the claim. It was
held elsewhere, that the date of accident would be relevant to fix the
law applicable, and the insurer would not be liable for passengers
carried in a Goods Vehicle [(Cholletti Bharathamm 2008 (2) LW 1 (SC):
2008 (2) TN MAC 29 (SC)].</p>
<p>As on date, the binding case law on the subject would be [(Asharanis
Case) 2003 ACJ 1 (SC)] in respect of accidents occurring under MV Act,
1988. As per [(Thokchom Ongbi Sangeeta and another vs. Oriental
Insurance Company Ltd &amp; Ors.) 2008 ACJ 6 (SC)], the insurer is not
liable to pay and recover, where provisions of the 1988 Act do not
enjoin any statutory liability on owner to get his vehicle insured for
passengers travelling in Goods Carriage. The Insurance Company must take
specific plea in the written statement quoting the aforesaid provision
and Thokchom Ongbi Sangeeta case (supra) to exonerate company&rsquo;s
liability absolutely. To substantiate the insurer&rsquo;s plea, positive
evidence should be adduced like summoning through Claims Tribunal, of
the investigating officer who has prepared the charge sheet. The
insurance company has to produce FIR, Charge sheet and the same should
be marked through independent witness or company official. The company
official may be asked to prove Section 2(14) and its purport, in the
light of the case of Thokchom Ongbi Sangeeta (supra). There was no
requirement to cover the risk to passengers carried in a goods vehicle.
[(New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Vedwati) 2007 ACJ 1043 (SC)]. In
[(NIC vs. Kaushalaya Devi) 2008 (4) Supreme 441] it was held that the
insurer was not liable to pay for a passenger in Goods Vehicle. In a
motor accident case, the employees of the owner were being transported
in the goods vehicle from their place of work. The claim was held not
tenable against the insurer since the employees had nothing to do with
the operation of the vehicle and had to be construed as unauthorised
occupants only under the Act policy. Where the deceased was the son of
the Owner of the Truck and there was no proof that he was accompanying
with the goods, he was held to be a gratuitous occupant in the goods
vehicle and the insurer was exonerated from liability. Where the victim
touched a goods vehicle touching an electric pole and was electrocuted,
the finding was that he was not a passenger and only a third party and
therefore, entitled to the claim from insurer. Where the gratuitous
occupant was alighting from the goods vehicle and had got down, he
ceased to be an occupant and would only be a third party victim The
liability to a passenger in a goods vehicle was held to be non- existent
under the MV Act, following the earlier decisions, unless such occupant
was a workman whose liability was restricted under EC Act, 1923.
Although the insurer was held not liable, it was held by Apex Court that
if the amount was already withdrawn the decision shall not be interfered
with. However, if the amount was not withdrawn the insurance company was
allowed to withdraw the deposit [(NIC vs Bhukya Tara) 2008 (4) Supreme
203]. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>In a case the insurer denied liability for an unauthorised occupant
carried in the goods vehicle. However, the insurer having failed to
produce the policy of insurance and establish their defence were held
liable but with liberty to seek recovery from the insured.</p>
<h2 id="e-passengers-in-tractor">e) Passengers in Tractor</h2>
<p>In [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd vs Brij Mohan) decided on
15.05.07] the Supreme Court observed that the injured-claimant was
merely a passenger travelling on the trolley attached to the tractor and
the tractor is not even a goods vehicle or vehicle for carrying
passengers. The Supreme Court, therefore, considered claimant as
unauthorised or gratuitous passenger. In respect of gratuitous
passengers, there are various other classes of vehicles involved. In
particular, persons travelling on a tractor are a class by themselves.
It is submitted that even if such persons were workmen carried on a
tractor, legally, the insurer would not be liable for such persons, when
they were travelling on the tractor.[( National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Chinnamma)-2004 (4) CTC 459 (SC)]. The Registration certificate permits
seating capacity for only one person, namely driver. There is no
physical space provided for carriage of any other person, other than the
driver. If so, the insurer cannot be expected to cover any person other
than the driver. As for coverage granted by the insurer to workmen
associated with the tractor, it would mean that such workmen, when
engaged in loading or unloading, when the vehicle was stationary would
alone be covered. When the vehicle is in motion there is no scope or
provision for coverage for such persons.</p>
<h2 id="f-workman-on-stationary-tractor">f) Workman on Stationary Tractor</h2>
<p>If the insurance policy has contemplated cover for workmen in
addition to driver, it can only be seen as covered when the workmen were
engaged in loading and unloading, while the vehicle was stationary.</p>
<h2 id="i-gratuitous-passengers-in-tractor-trailer">i. Gratuitous Passengers in Tractor-Trailer</h2>
<p>The insurer is not liable for
persons carried on tractor-trailer, being a passenger not covered [2008
(2) LW 19 (SC)]. When the tractor-trailer was used other than for
agricultural purpose it was held that the insurer has to pay and recover
the amount. In a case where the labourer was carried in a
tractor-trailer, the trailer was not insured, and the purpose of
carriage was for digging of mud for brick kiln, not an agricultural
purpose. It was held that such person was not covered under the contract
of insurance.</p>
<p>But in exercise of discretion under Art.136 the insurer was directed to
pay and recover [(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Brij Mohan) 2007 ACJ
1909 (SC)]. In another case the claim for a coolie carried in a
tractor, the owner of the vehicle was held liable to meet the claim, on
the grounds that risk to such person&rsquo;s was not required to be covered.
In another case a person was carried in a tractor-trailer, with the
trailer un-insured, the insurer was exonerated of the liability Even
though the tractor-trailer would be construed as a goods carriage, but
the fact remains that there is no physical space for carrying persons,
as such coverage to such persons may not arise. This decision should be
seen in the light of the applicability of the judgment [in (Asha Ranis
Case) 2003 ACJ 1 (SC)] exonerating the insurer completely in view of no
statutory liability enjoyed by him by the act of legislature.</p>
<h2 id="g-number-of-persons-covered-as-gratuitous-passenger">g) Number of persons covered as gratuitous passenger</h2>
<p>As to the number of such
persons who could be carried in a goods vehicle, which also is breached
more often than not, one has to refer to the seating capacity in the
Registration Certificate. The insurer&rsquo;s liability would be restricted to
such number of persons permitted, to be carried in the vehicle. The
relevant Rules in each State provides for number of persons that can be
carried in a goods vehicle. The liability of insurer would be restricted
to such number only. The insurer would be liable only for the permitted
number carried in Goods Vehicle. They would be liable for the highest of
the 6 award amounts as held [in (NIA vs. Prabhu 2008 (7) MLJ 229)].
All claims in excess thereof would have to be borne by the insured. The
liability for 6 persons claims was fixed as being first six,
chronologically in the absence of any other methodology available. This
may not be the best solution but no other equitable solution appears
possible in law. Although overloading is not a defence available to the
insurer, they are entitled to restrict their liability to the permitted
number. If so, it may be possible to conclude that the insurer may have
to pay for all the claimants and seek recovery in respect of those
claims in excess of 6 persons and that being decided chronologically,
subject to the fact that the persons so carried are entitled to coverage
in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="h-third-party-and-not-gratuitous-passenger">h) Third Party and not Gratuitous Passenger</h2>
<p>The persons going to pick up empty boxes are no passengers accompanying
goods, therefore, insurer was not liable [in (NIC vs. Kaushalya
Devi)-CA No. 9910/2006 date of judgement. 13/5/2008].</p>
<p>Where labourers were travelling along with logs of woods the claim was
held tenable In a case of a claim for the death of an owner of household
articles being carried in the goods vehicle, it was held sustainable, as
the insurer had failed to prove that the victim was only a gratuitous
occupant [in (P. Annamma vs. N. N. A. Patrick) 2007 ACJ 830 (AP)]. In
another case, mere carriage of a bag or two of grains in a goods vehicle
would not amount to carriage goods. Such occupant has to be construed as
gratuitous occupant only, not entitled for statutory cover under the
contract of insurance [in (United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Smt.
Lalithbai) 2007 AIHC 2063 (Kant): 2007 ACJ 2342 (Kant)]. The insurer
having failed to establish that the victims were gratuitous occupants,
as against the pleading that they were accompanying the fertilizer, they
were held liable for the claims [in (National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Lakhuben Punabhai Vaghari) 2007 ACJ 2253 (Guj)].</p>
<h2 id="i-pay-and-recover-for-gratuitous-passenger-risk-in-goods-carriage">i) Pay and Recover for Gratuitous Passenger risk in Goods Carriage</h2>
<p>It has been clearly held
that the power to direct pay and recover was exercisable by the Supreme
Court only as held [in (NIA vs. Vinayaga Moorthi) 2008 (7) MLJ 588].
In one case a person was carried in goods vehicle but the insurer was
held not liable (for claim). However, the claimant was permitted to
retain the amount already withdrawn and for the balance of award the
claimant was allowed to proceed against the owner [in (NIC vs.
Chennaiammal 2008 (4) LW 495)]. In another case a person was travelling
on the mudguard of a tractor belonging to 3 brothers, while the son of
one of the brothers was driving the tractor, without having a driving
licence. The Apex Court invoked its discretion under Art.142 and the
insurer was asked to pay and recover [in (2008) (2) Supreme 144
Darshana Devi]: [2008 (3) LW 28: 2008 (1) TN MAC 322].</p>
<h2 id="j-gratuitous-passenger-in-a-private-car">j) Gratuitous passenger in a Private Car</h2>
<p>The High Court of Gujarat decided that the
insurance company was not liable to meet the claim for gratuitous
occupant carried in a private car or as a pillion rider on a 2-wheeler
unless the insured had paid additional premium for such coverage in
[2008 ACJ 61 (Guj)], it was ruled that payment of additional premium
alone was the criteria to cast liability for such persons on the
insurer. [(Mathew Joseph vs. Janaki) 2007 ACJ 912 (Ker): 2007 (II) ACC
140 (Ker) (FB)]: [(United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Bhagyalakshmi)
2007 ACJ 1676 (Kant)].</p>
<p>The scope of Act Liability only policy is restrictive as per Section 147
(b) (i), and does not cover occupants of the vehicle, although
passengers are not carried for hire or reward. The word any person in
the section has been differentiated connoting restrictive meaning, as
compared to word third party in relation to damage to any property. The
wording in Section II (a) relating to Third Party in Package Policy
covering Own damage and Third Party Liability has, however, been amended
by the TAC to include Occupants carried in the Motor car provided that
such occupants are not carried for Hire or reward, thereby, covering the
occupants whether with or without knowledge of the insured. In a case
where the victim was travelling in the private car in his capacity as
Regional Manager of the employer/owner of the vehicle, it was held that
there was no coverage for such a victim under the contract of insurance.
The claim was not sustainable on the private car insurance policy, as
the risk was not required to be covered and not covered also.
[(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Meena Variyal) 2007 ACJ 1284 (SC)].
On a reading of the terms of the contract of insurance, a comprehensive
policy, that insurer had offered cover to occupants carried in or upon
the private car except those carried for hire or reward and in the
absence of proof that the victim was carried for hire or reward, it was
held that the insurer was liable to meet the occupants claim.
[(Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Nakirikanti Narendra Babu) 2007 ACJ
2069 (AP)]. In 2008 ACJ 61 (Guj) the risk to such persons under a
comprehensive policy was considered and the insurer was held liable. The
claim was preferred in respect of a fare-paying passenger carried in a
private vehicle, where such carriage was not permitted. The defence of
the insurer that such claim was not tenable more so under the
contractual Personal Accident liability was not maintainable before the
Tribunal and was rejected as being technical. The risk to passengers
carried having been covered the insurer was directed to pay. [(United
India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Keludappa) 2007 ACJ 1241 (Kant)].</p>
<h2 id="k-no-cover-for-pillion-rider-or-gratuitous-occupants">k) No cover for Pillion Rider or Gratuitous Occupants</h2>
<p>The liability of insurer
to a pillion rider as a gratuitous occupant would depend upon the cover
granted by the insurer whether under Act Policy or Package Policy. In
respect of an Act Policy such persons are not required to be covered. It
is only under a Package policy that such persons are covered by the
Contract of Insurance. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in
[(United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Tilak Singh) 2006 ACJ 1441: 2006
(2) ACC 1], it was held that the insurer would not be liable to a
pillion rider under an Act Policy.</p>
<p>In case of death of a pillion rider under Section 163A defence of the
insurer that the risk to such persons was not required to be covered,
was rejected on the premise that for liability under Section 163-A it
was irrelevant to determine about the status of the deceased as pillion
rider or a third party etc. [(National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Rukshanaben Salimbai Vora)]. Section 163-A does not take away the right
of insurer to dispute liability under the contract of insurance, and it
is not as if notwithstanding provision of cover insurer would still have
to pay. Section 163-A only precludes a contest on negligence, if any.</p>
<h2 id="l-personal-accident-liability-to-owner-and-other-occupants">l) Personal Accident liability to Owner and other Occupants</h2>
<p>The claim for
insured-owner of the vehicle in [(The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Chopri Devi) AIR 2007 Uttarakhand 62]: [2007 (4) TAC 303], while
driving the motor vehicle, was held not sustainable under the contract
of insurance. However, a sum of Rs. 200,000/- contemplated under the
contractual Personal Accident cover was held tenable and directed to be
paid to the claimants. In [(United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.
Sunanda) 2007 ACJ 1715 (Bom)], where the deceased was owner- driver of
the 2 wheeler, the Personal Accident cover of Rs.1,00,000/- was held
liable under the contract of insurance.</p>
<h2 id="i-position-as-per-tac-provisions">i. Position as per TAC provisions</h2>
<p>By reason of the decision in [(Pushpabai&rsquo;s Case) 1977 ACJ
343] delivered on 25/3/77 the insurers were held not liable for
gratuitous occupants carried in a private vehicle under a Policy. The
Tariff Advisory Committee in its wisdom deemed it fit to issue a
Circular dated 17/3/78 to the effect that insurers shall offer cover to
gratuitous occupants carried in a private car, which shall take effect
from 25/3/77; the date on which Supreme Court delivered its verdict. It
was made clear that such cover was available under Comprehensive
Policies of insurance [in (Minor Harshvardhatiya Rudradithya vs.
Jyotindra Chimanlal Parikh) 1981 ACJ 277 (Guj)]. Subsequently in
respect of pillion riders also the Tariff Advisory Committee issued a
circular dated 1/6/96 that persons carried in or upon pillion, except
those carried for hire or reward for inclusion for coverage under a
Comprehensive Policy of Motor Insurance will be covered. Hence the
insurers, under the present dispensation, be it the MV Act, 1988 or the
new Tariff regime from 1/7/2002, have been consistent in projecting that
under an Act Policy they have not offered cover to pillion riders or
gratuitous occupants in a private car. They have, however, offered cover
to such persons under a Comprehensive cover. This position of law has
been vindicated in the most recent decision.</p>
<p>However, it is eminently possible that the Courts may continue to hold
that notwithstanding the absence of such liability, the insurer may
still have to pay and seek recovery only. However, it would be
erroneous, since there is no statutory liability attaching to the
insurer and so it cannot be considered akin to a Breach of Condition of
Policy.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Limit of Liability</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>When there is limit of liability, the
insurer cannot be asked to pay and seek recovery. In a case where the
victim was a Third Party to a goods vehicle, and no additional premium
was paid, it was held that the insurers liability was as per 1939 Act
only. [(The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Jeevan Janga) 2007 AIHC
2483 (All)]. In respect of an accident occurring on 22/6/87 involving a
goods vehicle, it was held that the liability of the insurer was
restricted to Rs. 1,50,000/- only under the insurance cover, but the
insurer was directed to pay and seek recovery of the excess from the
insured. The Act policy of insurance was brought on record, but no
official was examined to prove the same. Thereby, benefit of doubt was
made available to the Third Party and the insurer was directed to bear
the entire liability and not the contractual limit thereof. [(New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Smt.Nirmala Devi) 2007 (3) TAC 414 (Del)]:
[(Rajesh Kumar vs. Gurnam Kaur) 2007 (3) TAC 501 (P&amp;H)]. Therefore, it
is a must to prove the insurance documents for limited liabilities.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>a) In England the Motor Insurance Bureau takes on responsibility
to compensate Third Parties for motor accidents involving vehicles that
are uninsured, or untraced. b) In India, motor insurance is mandatory
vide Section 146 MV Act, 1988. c) Motor Vehicle Act is a benevolent
legislation as far as compensation is payable towards third party
liability. d) It is generally understood that the person seeking
insurance must have a legal right to insure the subject matter of
insurance. Therefore, insurers insist on the Registration Certificate of
the vehicle being in the name of the insured, at the time of availing
cover. e) In practice, subrogation has been modified by Knock for Knock
agreement between insurers in case of liability arising out of physical
damage to vehicles involved and respective insurers meet full liability
of vehicles insured by them. f) Section 146 is amended by Amendment Act
1994 to cast an additional duty that the owner of the vehicle carrying
dangerous or hazardous goods shall also go in for a policy of insurance
under the ―Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991‖. g) All motor policies
contain a clause called ―Avoidance of certain terms and right of
recovery‖. h) The provisions relating to compulsory third party
insurance do not apply to any vehicle owned by the Central Government or
a State Government and used for Government purposes unconnected with any
commercial enterprise. i) Section 150 Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides
for the rights of third parties in the event of the insolvency of the
insured or in the event of winding up when the insured is a Company. j)
Section 155 of 1988 Act provides that if the insured person dies after
incurring third party liability, then the cause of action survives
against the insured&rsquo;s estate, or legal heirs or against the insurer. k)
Section 163 (A) contains special provision as to payment of compensation
on ―structural formula basis‖.</p>
<p>l) The following persons can prefer claims for death or disability due
to negligence of the driver of a vehicle: i. i. i. iv. v.</p>
<p>Pedestrians . Fare paying passengers . Non-fare paying passengers
Persons travelling in other vehicles Children</p>
<p>m) An allegation of negligence may be rebutted by the following
defences: i. Volenti Non-fit injuria i . Inevitable accident ii. . Act
of God iv. Emergency n) Where a person is injured without any negligence
on his part but as a result of the combined effect of the negligence of
two other persons, it is not a case of contributory negligence but a
case of injury by composite negligence. o) Principle of Apportionment
for passenger vehicles: Where a passenger vehicle is found overloaded
and the number of claimants exceeds the seating capacity of the vehicle
as per R.C. Book, the insurers are required to pay to the extent of
permitted seating capacity, by choosing the highest awarded amounts of
claims, which is distributed amongst all the cases equally. p) Option to
move EC Commissioner or Motor Accident Claims Tribunal: As per Section
167 of MV Act, 1988 it is open to the workman to exercise an option to
move MACT or go before the EC Commissioner. q) Motor Accidents Claims
Tribunals (MACT): For the speedy disposal of third party claims and at a
minimum cost, the Claims Tribunals have been constituted by different
State Governments, under Section 110 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. r)
Section 173 provides for provision of filing Appeal for a person
aggrieved by an award of MACT. However, there is a bar on filing appeal
for an award of a Claims Tribunal if the amount in dispute is less than
ten thousand rupees. s) The Tribunals have all the powers and trappings
of a Civil Court. One important adjunct of the power of a Civil Court
being available to the MACT is the power in relation to review or recall
of an award against the insurer in case fraud is established later.</p>
<p>t) Pay and Recover for victims on the road only: Supreme Court has
clarified that in the absence of driving licence per se, the insurer
cannot be asked to pay and recover. u) Alternate methods of settlement
include: i. Conciliatory Committee i . Joint Compromise Petition i i.
Jald Rahat Yojna iv. Consensual Adjudication v. Lok Adalat vi. Permanent
Lok Adalat for ‗Insurance Service&rsquo; vi . Solatium Fund v) Three basic
principles governing determination of compensation in injury disablement
claims: i. Principle of Assessability i . Principle of Uniformity ii. .
Principle of Predictability w) Kinds of damages include pecuniary
damages and non-pecuniary damages. x) The Court has the discretion to
adopt a suitable multiplier, be it higher than the schedule or lesser
than it for good and valid reasons, but shall, however, not exceed 18 at
the maximum. y) In order to defend Motor Third Party liability cases
effectively the insurance company must collect all relevant documents
through investigator relating to: i. Accident site details i . Contact
with insured i i. Contact with driver iv. Contact with claimants /
deceased representatives / friends and neighbours / colleagues v. Police
Papers vi. RTO Papers vi . Medical Papers z) An insurer can contest the
proceedings before the Claims Tribunal only on any of the grounds
prescribed under Section 149 (2) of the 1988 Act, and unless specific
permission is granted by the Claims Tribunal under Section 170 of the
1988 Act, the insurer cannot contest the case on grounds other than
those mentioned in Section 149 (2) of the 1988 Act.</p>
<p>aa) Section 64 VB of Insurance Act, 1938 for advance payment of premium
renders contract void ab initio but the fact of dishonor of cheque must
be communicated to insured and RTA effectively to exonerate from
statutory liability of payment by Insurer. bb) To avoid liability
towards the insured, the insurer has to prove that the insured was
guilty of negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care in the
matter of fulfilling the condition of the policy regarding use of
vehicles by a duly licensed driver or one who was not been disqualified
to drive at the relevant time. cc) When there is limit of liability, the
insurer cannot be asked to pay and seek recovery.</p>
<h2 id="answers-to-test-yourself">Answers to Test Yourself</h2>
<p>Answer 1 The correct answer is III. In Germany,

authority of Divisional-in-house Conciliatory Committee (DICC) for Motor
TP claims is Rs. 10,00,000/-. Answer 6 The correct option is I. Three
