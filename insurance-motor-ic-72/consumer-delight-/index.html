<h2 id="chapter-introduction">Chapter Introduction</h2>
<p>In this chapter you will learn about the evolution of the quality service concept and the
basic elements of customer service. The chapter also discusses the
regulatory, statutory, self and internal commitments. In the end the
chapter explores the service gaps in motor claims and related customer
experience management.</p>

<h2 id="service">EVOLUTION OF QUALITY SERVICE CONCEPT AND BASIC ELEMENTS OF CUSTOMER
SERVICE</h2>
<ol>
<li>Evolution of Quality Service Concept</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Quality is a timeless
concept, and the origins of the human approach to managing quality are
hidden in the mists of ancient past. We can be sure that humans have
always faced problems of quality.</p>
<h2 id="a-caveat-emptor">a) Caveat Emptor</h2>
<p>In the olden days the
seller was responsible for supplying the goods but the buyer became
responsible for assuring himself of the quality. This arrangement came
to be known as the doctrine of Caveat emptor, let the buyer beware.
Their failure to be aware was at their own peril.</p>
<h2 id="b-quality-management">b) Quality Management</h2>
<p>With the passage of time, quality protection shifted to quality
assurance giving rise to the concept of quality specifications. This led
to quality management. This brought two types of improvements to fore:
i.</p>
<p>Improvement aimed at customer satisfaction including product innovation</p>
<p>i . Improvement aimed at reducing customer dissatisfaction by bringing
down chronic waste, inspection and test Thus took birth of quality
control process: i.</p>
<p>by evaluating actual quality being produced;</p>
<p>i . its comparison with quality goal and ii. . taking corrective action
if quality does not conform to the goal c) Japanese Quality Revolution
With the rise of consumerism in the 20th century immediately after World
War II, the Japanese Quality revolution was launched during 1950&rsquo;s.
Within a few decades, that revolution propelled Japan to a position of
World Leadership in Quality. It led to increased competition in quality
leading to customer focus.</p>
<h2 id="d-philip-crosbys-observations">d) Philip Crosby‟s Observations</h2>
<p>It is the management systems rather
than workers who are cause of poor quality service. It is found that
with 99% efficiency of 100 workers makes the organisation efficiency
barely 36.4%. Philip Crosby argues that poor quality in the average
costs about 20% of revenues. His absolutes of quality are ‗conformance
to requirements&rsquo; not goodness and the system for achieving quality is
‗prevention&rsquo;, not appraisal. The performance standard is Zero Defect
which is not ―that close enough‖. The measurement of quality is the
price of non-conformance, not indexes. Crosby states that ―Quality is
free‖, because the small cost of prevention will always be lower than
the cost of detection, correction and failure.</p>
<h2 id="e-rewards-of-higher-quality">e) Rewards of higher quality</h2>
<p>The rewards of higher quality produce include: i. greater
customer loyalty; i . improved market share; ii. . higher returns to
shareholders; iv. reduced service calls; v. higher prices; vi. greater
productivity</p>
<h2 id="important">Important</h2>
<p>Jose Rose said, &ldquo;Quality begins and ends with the customers.
The fundamental principal is that the quality is what the buyer defines
it as not what the company defines it to be.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Impact of Nationalisation</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>a) Increase in reach: Nationalisation has spread the
message of insurance to every nook and corner of the country. b)
Development of human resource and expertise: The insurers have become
financially strong and developed large human resource brimming with
requisite skills and expertise to match any international standards. c)
Reduction in policy cost: The industry has given lowest paid policies to
customer absorbing cost of commission and has developed unique rural
package covers. d) Social obligations: The sector continued to cross
subsidise to meet out social liabilities to motor accident victims
despite adverse claims ratio. e) Stable market: The insurance sector has
succeeded in providing a very stable market. IC-72 MOTOR INSURANCE</p>
<p>f) Customer friendly initiatives: The industry has introduced unique
concept in settling claims, affirming commitment that ―customer is the
purpose of business and we will not deny him any legitimate claim on
technical grounds‖. Despite such grand track record, customer is not
satisfied with the insurance industry. He is shouting from the rooftop
about the poor quality of service.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Objectives of Opening the Insurance Sector</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>One of the principal objectives of opening the
insurance industry to private sector has been to improve and upgrade the
quality of services offered to the consumers. Therefore, time has
already come to delve into quality of customer services in insurance
industry which is unfolding in the current scenario. The liberalisation
of economy has triggered opening up of insurance sector. The opening up
of the sector has given a sort of jubilations to consumer. The benefits
of competitive marketing should percolate down to the consumers. There
could be several parameters to evaluate the quality of these services.
These could be in terms of: i. Time taken in delivery of policy
documents, i . Fast settlement of claims to the satisfaction of the
claimant, i i. Wide spectrum of products to be selected from lower
pricing, iv. After sale contacts with the consumers on a periodic basis
etc.</p>

<p>Peter F. Drucker said &ldquo;The company that understands and
anticipates customer needs, delivers consistently high levels of service
and connects to customers via the channels of choice wins&rdquo;. Insurance is
a ―people centric business‖ and people includes various stake holders
viz i. Policyholders, i . Claimants, ii. . Beneficiaries and iv.
Intermediaries ‗Seamless service&rsquo; to ‗service full of seams&rsquo; is the
order of the day. The customer sensitivity is needed from insurance
stake holders, and customer service needs to be assessed from the point
of &ldquo;Under promise and over deliver&rdquo; vs &ldquo;over-promise and under-deliver&rdquo;.
What cannot be measured can never be assessed.</p>
<p>To understand customer satisfaction one needs to look into customer
perception of image about the services through i. Expectations of
services and experience of services, i . The design quality (quality of
policy) and ii. . Servuction quality (production and delivery of
quality) 4. Basic Elements of Customer Service Diagram 1: Basic elements

<p>The Consumer

<li>Customer Experience Management</li>

distribution &amp; redressal, i i. Attract customers by professional
selling, and iv. Evolve customer sensitisation through customer directed
efforts</p>
<p>SERVICE GAPS IN CLAIMS AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>Customer Experience Management (CEM) is one of the most important
customer strategies for today's business: i. i. i.</p>
<p>It creates direct impact on insurers brand; . It works as a guiding
principle for designing a customer-centric business process; . It
influences every staff that acts as customer touch-points during the
total customer experience process</p>
<h2 id="a-be-a-friend-of-your-customer">a) Be a Friend of Your Customer</h2>
<p>All too often we come across some case,
usually in a consumer court, being decided against an insurer and in
favour of a client. In one such case the client, a resident of Navi
Mumbai, reported the theft of his car. Police reports were submitted,
the insurer appointed an investigator, the claim note was also approved.
A day before the cheque was to be issued; the stolen vehicle was
recovered by the police. The vehicle was suspected to have been stolen
by alleged terrorists in connection with the blasts at Akshardham
temple. Since the vehicle was recovered prior to the insurer issuing the
cheque, the insurer denied liability. More than 10 years later, the car
is still in police custody as &quot;material evidence&quot;.&hellip; and the client
is still running from pillar to post. There are two aspects under motor
theft claims: i. If the vehicle was recovered prior to settlement of the
claim including issue of the settled amount, the insured should accept
the recovered vehicle immediately. i . If there are damages or change in
color / theft of spares, under the said claim, such spares is / is
payable including the prescribed towing charges against same claim
intimation. The policy only requires the matter to be reported to the
police. Even an FIR is not mandatory. In view of various judgments cited
on the issue any delay in settlement beyond 90 days has little
justification as stipulated by the regulations of the IRDA also. The
fact that an insured peril has operated causing a loss, must be taken as
sufficient trigger to accept liability and pay the claim. The insurer
should settle immediately if we talk of consumer delight</p>
<h2 id="b-insurers-primary-service">b) Insurer‟s Primary Service</h2>
<p>What is insurer&rsquo;s primary service? Is it issuing cover
note or policy or settling claims? When consumer is said to be
satisfied? Whose satisfaction is important, insurers or insured&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>These are some questions which need to be addressed when talking of
consumer delight. Consumer is delighted only when his genuine claim is
settled without any hassles. Are insurance companies taking any efforts
to settle claims and settle them expeditiously? Paradoxically all
actions taken by insurers are in terms of claims settlement ratio, which
ironically does not account for number of claims closed as no claim and
number of claims where the insured disputed quantum of claim. Insurers
do not adhere to turnaround time for settlement of claim, assistance
given to client in speedy settlement of claim. Should insurers&rsquo; not
provide Claims Councilors&rsquo; to help the client to take his claim?</p>
<h2 id="i-claims-counselor">i. Claims Counselor</h2>
<p>Insurers should have Relationship Managers as claims counselors who will
reach the client and help him in obtaining all documents and shifting of
vehicle for repairs, procuring estimates and in consultation with
surveyour make him reach to an amicable settlement. Ensure that scrap
(sic salvage) items are duly verified and disposed off expeditiously and
economically. Help client in verification of the vehicular documents and
arrange for transfer of Registration papers in case of Total loss or
theft claims.</p>
<h2 id="ii-third-party-counselors">ii. Third Party counselors‟</h2>
<p>In case of third party injury
claims, the beneficiary is left to fend for themselves where the black
coat provides all help according to his professional understanding.
Whose client is beneficiary in any case? Should insurers not help them
in reaching to amicable compromise settlement? The need of the hour is
‗TP counselors&rsquo; who will help the injured or legal representatives of
deceased by extending services of their tie up hospitals where the
accident victims are taken for treatment / convulsing.</p>
<h2 id="c-culture-of-helping-attitude">c) Culture of Helping Attitude</h2>
<p>The client must feel that insurance company is willing,
even to the extent of going out of way, to settle the claim. The culture
of helping attitude and standing behind the client for his financial
safety must be the motto of each employee. This requires the insurers to
change their attitude of finding faults to reduce payments or repudiate
the claims or hoodwinking the client to submit him to accept lower
amounts as full and final settlements.</p>
<h2 id="d-bond-of-trust-and-confidence">d) Bond of Trust and Confidence</h2>
<p>Consumer delight is possible when a
bond of trust is created by insurer with the client so that client is
not left to fend for themselves. The maximum number of claims are
disputed by insurers in the courts on the ground that the client has
accepted the claim in full and final settlement while the client remains
dissatisfied and accepts partial payment to recompense his losses to
some extent if not fully. Similarly in TP claims, if all other policy
requirements are met, insurers must not only offer compromise amount on
the basis of just compensation arrived but also deposit in the court
with the consent to release the amount and let the case be then
contested on the principle of fault liability. This will enthuse
confidence in the beneficiaries and build a degree of trust about
insurance company&rsquo;s best intentions to settle the claim. What needs to
be done is to affirm this trust and confidences that the insurance
company is solidly behind the genuine claimants always to provide
consumer delight. When a client prefers his insurance claim, the whole
insurance team must be extremely supportive and be seen as taking the
claim in all possible and correct manner for the damages and be ready to
help in getting the vehicle back with a smiling face for me. Neither the
dealer should have any complaints for the services of insurer nor should
the client hold any odd views. The client expects help with respect and
responsive services. Test Yourself 2 Insurance ombudsman has been
